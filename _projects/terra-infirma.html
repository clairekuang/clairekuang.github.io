<p id="body_title_major">CAPITAL, COMMODITY, AND INFRASTRUCTURE</p>
<p>
    The narrative of post-industrial capital, in so far as it is capable of transforming at scale the
    material landscape of wealth into self- reinforcing structures of organization and power, is reaching
    a critical point with the advent of modern urbanization. As succinctly surmised by Mark Weiser in his
    1991 essay in Scientific American, “the most profound technologies are those that disappear...they
    weave themselves into the fabric of everyday life until they are indistinguishable from it”.
    Contemporary infrastructures in this sense are radically reshaping the processes, politics, and
    aesthetics of commodification and commodity fetishization that have been the hallmark of capital
    accumulation in the 20th century. In looking at the material foundation of capital and currency
    following the industrial revolution, this thesis nosedives into the relationship between power, capital,
    and the built environment through a case study of the global dynamics surrounding the implementation of
    the gold standard in the early 1800’s, and the unprecedented metamorphosis of Johannesburg’s urban
    landscape that resulted in the following century.

<p id="body_title_minor">1.01<span class="tab"></span>Value, in perpetuity</p>
<p>
    To situate the terms ‘capital’, ‘commodity’, and ‘infrastructure’ within a Marxist framework, capital
    is defined as the accumulation of wealth specifically through the process of circulation - a dynamic
    driven by the difference between a commodity’s use value and its exchange value. The capitalist then
    understands this value as being in constant motion, where profit is generated through perpetual
    reinvestment and consequent augmentation of exchange value. The nature of this value-added exchange is
    then contextualized through how one chooses to define the term ‘commodity’; and indeed, the chasm
    between commodity as it first appears in Das Kapital and as it is currently understood in the global
    markets is quite extensive. To Marx, commodity was “an object outside us, a thing that by its
    properties satisfies human wants of some sort or another”, and where “the nature of such wants, whether,
    for instance, they spring from the stomach or from fancy, makes no difference...neither are we here
    concerned to know how the object satisfies these wants, whether directly as means of subsistence, or
    indirectly as means of production”. This definition is metaphysical in disposition, and is concerned
    less with the tangible qualifications by which a specific externality is commodified than it is with
    the understanding that commodification is a process implicitly tied to human desire. As such, desire
    being a fickle beast, the commodity is monadic as a unit endowed with perceptual virtue, and it is this
    appended quality that gains in value through transformations of exchange by social and political forces.
</p>
<p id="body_title_minor">1.02<span class="tab"></span>Consumptive futures</p>
<p>
    Contemporary economics, however, defines the commodities trade far more tangibly: such objects are
    typically uniform in pricing across many markets, are used in the production of othergoods, and can be
    extracted or grown and traded in sufficiently high quantities. These traits allow them to support
    extremely liquid markets in which futures and options are often sold to protect both producers and
    consumers against fluctuations in price. In this context, the commodity necessarily exists on a global
    scale, and its value in trade is defined not by a consistent growth in exchange value but rather by the
    ease with which they can be converted into money through their use in other, more refined products.
    Thus cocoa, copper, wheat, oil, and coal qualify whereas diamonds, due to their inconsistencies in
    quality, and natural gas, due to its predisposition for price determination through long term regional
    contracts, do not. The modern commodity exists in material form only briefly; its primary purpose is to
    be liquidated as quickly as possible for as much as possible. The selling of futures - the functional
    equivalent of the Marxist exchange value - is now complete in its disembodiment from the physical
    realities of the object itself, acting as a stand-in independent from the actual volume of material
    being extracted or produced. Where the Marxist perspective portrays the commodity as an object with
    appended metaphysical value, in perpetual circulation, the economics of today suggest they are transient
    one-way pipelines from production at scale to diversified, globalized consumption.

<p id="body_title_minor">1.03<span class="tab"></span>Material mediators</p>
<p>
    In this discourse, the term ‘infrastructure’ exists purely in relation to the flows that enable capital
    accumulation through the production and consumption of commodities. Maria Kaika and Erik Swyngedouw
    identify technological networks as the “material mediators between nature and the city; they carry the
    flow and process of transformation of one into the other”. The process of assigning market relations to
    socially metabolized goods is fundamentally dependent on the process of fetishization, which in the
    Marxist sense is the quantification of the qualitative that allows for abstraction to take over. The
    fetishized commodity supplies its own ideology in the market, and allows for augmentations of its
    exchange value without revealing the socioenvironmental circumstances of its production.
</p>
<p id="body_title_minor">1.04<span class="tab"></span>First monumental, then mundane</p>
<p>
    Commodity fetishism in the modern era merged economics, politics, and culture to materially
    enact an ideology of progress, resulting in behemoth infrastructures which served as monuments
    to engineering and technological progress. In the span of a decade from 1904-1914, the
    construction of the Panama Canal resulted in the excavation of more than 130 million cubic meters
    of earth. The Great Depression gave birth to the Hoover Dam, impounding Lake Mead for
    hydroelectric power and containing more than 3.3 million cubic meters of concrete. These
    megastructures operated at a scale unfathomable to the human body, iconic in both size and impact.
    With the abandonment of this techno-optimist ideology following the abysmal living conditions
    characteristic of post-industrial cities and the mechanical destruction of the two world wars,
    came the erasure of urban networks from visible, physical space; a transition from the monumental
    to the mundane. Contemporary urban infrastructures are invisible: pipes, cables, electronic waves
    that sever the connection between the social transformation of nature and the process of
    urbanization. In this sense, physical infrastructures are the residue, the material byproducts of
    the process of capitalism, viewed only as instruments in the service of additional value
    extraction, and can be extended to include the material city itself - and embedded in this
    material manifestation are power dynamics which facilitate the flow of capital, often in service
    of those with purchasing wealth. In our globalized economy, these flows transcend geographic and
    political boundaries, directionally fixed from sites of extraction to territories of mass consumption.

<p id="body_title_minor">1.05<span class="tab"></span>Infrastructure in motion</p>
<p>
    Here we stumble upon a fundamental paradox of capital as it relates to infrastructure: how does one
    reconcile the dynamism of capital in perpetual motion and fluctuation with infrastructur that is
    static and immobile in space? One could argue that this tension manifests as the creative destruction
    of the built environment and ceaseless restructuring of scale economies, characteristic of the
    cityscape in advanced capitalism. Instability, in the urban context, thus occurs when a paradigm shift
    in capital flow commands a radical restructuring of the physical infrastructures that must adjust to
    enable its realization. From this several questions arise: how does the erratic flow of capital affect
    the colonization of nature? How can one intervene in the static, built environment to influence these
    flows, either to stabilize or stimulate its corresponding capitalist system? How will infrastructure’s
    legacy manifest itself both materially and aesthetically upon future cityscapes?<br><br>
    Identifying infrastructures as being primary, secondary, or tertiary respective to its corresponding
    role in extraction, commodification, and information distribution, then commodification with the
    emergence of late capitalism shows tertiary infrastructures with ever increasing scale and scope,
    inversely related to their presence in physical space. The long timescales and inertia of built
    infrastructure, when contrasted with the immediacy and rapid evolution of digital information and
    boom/bust cycles poses significant point of investigation for this project. In looking at the
    post-industrial evolution of currency from the gold standard to the digital, we can perhaps draw some
    conclusions about how modern societies can develop resiliency in the face of rapid capital flows as we
    mature through the age of information.
</p>
<p id="body_title_minor">1.06<span class="tab"></span>The Gold Standard</p>
<p>
    Arguably the most classically transformative paradigm shift in the history of currency, the
    establishment of a formal gold standard among the major trading nations during the 19th century reveal
    the scale and scope to which capital flows can reshape the urban and its subsidiary landscape. Gold has
    existed as a form of currency since as early as 610BC, but it wasn’t until the era of colonization and
    rapidly expanding global markets that the  metal became incongruously cumbersome to transport across
    vast distances. Where before the value of the gold coin was embedded in the material of the coin
    itself, the introduction of the gold standard allowed for a more efficient representation of value - in
    this case, paper currency - that was still fixed upon some definite quantity of gold.<br><br>
    This new mode of representation not only facilitated the global trade by establishing trust between
    governments which could redeem any amount of paper money for its value in gold, but it also kickstarted
    a global feedback loop between gold mines, gold markets, and government. Burgeoning multinational trade
    heightened demand for gold to back the standards in the US and Europe, especially gold which could be
    mined as cheaply as possible to maximize the profits of colonizing nations. In turn, as their wealth
    grew so too did the volume of trade, propelling the demand for gold ever higher. Britain was the first
    to adopt a gold specie standard in 1821, followed by the United States and Germany in 1873.
</p>
<p id="body_title_minor">1.07<span class="tab"></span>Critical instabilities</p>
<p>
    This system, however, proved unstable as each injection of new gold into these economies also meant a
    drop in the value of gold and their corresponding currencies. Instability reached critical thresholds
    with the advent of the first world war, when the standard was suspended to enable bulk printing of
    paper currency to fund military involvement - instigating a period of hyperinflation as the value of
    currency was no longer stabilized to a regulated material form. The standard failed once again during
    the Great Depression, as investors began trading in currencies which subsequently raised the value of
    gold and promoted widespread hoarding during the fallout of trust in American banking institutions
    following the stock market crash. An equally powerful counterswing instigated by Roosevelt, in an
    attempt to stymy depletion, then resulted in the largest global consolidation of gold stock in the
    Federal Reserve. Because of this majority share, the US dollar had become the de facto world currency
    by the 1944 Bretton Woods Agreement, which fixed all exchange values in terms of gold.<br><br>
    This marked the beginning of a new dynamic in gold’s role as a commodity: where before its use value
    lay in the ease with which it could be liquidated (exchanged for cash), this function has now been
    replaced by cash itself. Instead of stockpiling gold, other countries began stockpiling the US dollar,
    thus turning a paper currency into a commodity, where its value is not fixed to some quantifiable
    material but rather to the scale and scope in which it is used. Though the gold standard officially
    ended on August 15, 1971 when the ballooning value of the US dollar due to its role as the linchpin
    of the world economy could no longer be backed by its gold reserves, and the Fed could no longer
    redeem dollars with gold, the metal continues to embody an asset of real value in the global social
    conscience, as exemplified in its purchase during periods of recession and inflation.

<p id="body_title_major">CITY OF GOLD</p>
<p>
    The ramifications of a globalized gold market as geopolitical infrastructure at the source of extraction
    and production are profound. A fascinating dive into the gold supply chain during the first four decades
    of the 20th century pinpoint the Transvaal region of South Africa as the supplier of 35% of the world’s
    gold production, and the approximately 50,000 tons of gold extracted since the end of the 19th century
    account for almost half of all gold ever mined through the course of human history. The transformations
    in this area, in particular the rapid conversion of a primarily agrarian society into the largest and
    richest metropolis of South Africa and the violence exacted upon its land and people, are inextricably
    tied to the politics behind the establishment and subsequent turbulences of the gold standard.
</p>
<p id="body_title_minor">2.01<span class="tab"></span>As Above, So Below</p>
<p>
    In the summer of 1886, prospectors struck gold on a small farm called Langlaate. This was the
    Witwatersrand Reef, which extends east-west for 400 kilometers and runs for some 5,000 meters below
    ground. Soon prospectors and migrant workers came and set up small mining camps wherever gold was
    struck, and Langlaate merged with clusters of other camps to form what is now the city of Johannesburg.
    Growth was explosive: in the year following discovery, the Reef in its entirety was estimated to
    contain some 7,000 people, less than half of which lived in Johannesburg itself. Not four years later,
    Johannesburg’s population had multiplied ten-fold, and by 1891 approximately 102,000 people resided in
    the city. The circumstances of Johannesburg’s formation, and the exponential growth that followed, is
    written permanently into the urban fabric. Previous gold discoveries in the Transvaal were all alluvial
    and thus transient in nature, and so the original subdivision of land in Johannesburg’s first camp
    clusters were closely spaced, typical of 19th century mine camp planning. By the time it became known
    that the Reef ran both deep and wide, the burgeoning class of migrant workers had already drawn lawyers,
    shopkeepers, and traders that converted the camps into more permanent buildings, crystallizing the
    original partition scheme into what is now Johannesburg’s central business district.<br><br>
    Transportation and other infrastructures materialized quickly within this period, with piped water,
    electricity, and telephones appearing in the first two years, and South Africa’s first railway system
    inaugurated by the beginning of 1890. Initially servicing the predominant east-west run of the Reef,
    these infrastructures soon had to negotiate the mining waste dumps, sometimes deposited just meters
    away from the mine entrances due to the initial ad hoc zoning restrictions, that resulted from a shift
    into deep-level mining after surface outcrops ran low. The problem of waste was further exacerbated by
    the low grade ore that characterized much of the Witwatersrand Reef, with some companies producing up to
    200,000 times as much waste as gold: an issue that only worsened as time progressed and deeper
    excavations were made to reach new deposits.

<p id="body_title_minor">2.02<span class="tab"></span>Landscapes of waste</p>
<p>
    Today, south African mining companies remove up to 7,500 tons of earth to produce one standard gold
    bar’s worth of product. Put into perspective, given that Johannesburg roughly produced a hypothetical
    40% of the gold in the US reserve at its peak, the equivalent waste mound would cover the entire
    footprint of Central Park with the height of One World Trade Center, four times over. As railway and
    automobile infrastructures continued to mature over the next few decades, connecting the sites of gold
    extraction with the major ports of South Africa for export, the tight weave of transit networks and
    waste formed a permanent and prominent belt along the east-west axis of the city and its subjugate
    landscape, splitting it into two distinct, unequal halves.<br><br>
    The material residue of gold mining in Johannesburg in turn shaped the geospatial division of
    socio-economic class, as delineated through the restructuring of power during the Second Boer War in
    1899 and the apartheid era politics that followed. At the crux of these political upheavals was a
    fundamental economic problem: how to make the low grade ore profitable? Deep-level mining required
    advanced knowledge and expensive machinery, which shifted the landscape of extraction from small-scale
    manual panning by opportunists at the onset to large-scale mining operations often owned by wealthy
    corporations abroad. As the extent of Witwatersrand Reef became clear, so too did political tensions
    over who would gain control of the lucrative resource, especially with the adoption of the gold
    standard. Established by the Boers after Great Britain annexed their Cape Colony during the Napoleonic
    Wars, the Transvaal and Orange Free State initially drew many foreigners to its borders with the
    discovery of diamonds at Kimberley in 1866. Soon after the discovery of gold in 1886, the Boers
    understood that they lacked both the manpower and the industrial expertise to develop the resource,
    and so reluctantly allowed the immigration of foreigners, called uitlanders, to the Transvaal. Many of
    these immigrants were English-speaking men from Britain, and soon their population challenged and
    potentially exceeded that of the original Boer settlers, which precipitated tensions between the two
    groups. In part driven by expansionist ideology, a notable proponent of which was mining magnate and
    early gold investor Cecil Rhodes, as well as attempts to obtain full voting rights for the uitlanders,
    the British attempted to raid the city in 1895 and finally gained control of the Transvaal and its
    allied Orange Free State in 1902.

<p id="body_title_minor">2.03<span class="tab"></span>Labor politics</p>
<p>
    With political ownership of Johannesburg’s gold established, it became clear that a profitable
    enterprise would not have been possible without an abundance of cheap, unskilled labor from
    disenfranchised migrant workers. The gold standard meant that pricing was internationally controlled,
    and so any increases in operational costs could not be passed down to consumers through price
    increases. The United States and other major European powers were major gold importers, and it was
    also in their best interests to keep the price of gold low; thus, maintaining a constant supply of
    cheap labor became a primary focus for both the Boer and British governments as well as the mine
    owners. The following decades oversaw the political, social, and economic control of a huge
    population of black Africans for this singular purpose. Through governmental and white acquisition of
    land, harsh property taxes, and militaristic destabilization of neighboring African nations, the
    development of the mining industry destroyed independent farming as a way of life and completely
    reconfigured the socioeconomic structures of South Africa. A host of governmental policies spanning
    the first four decades of the 20th century, ranging from the criminalization of job desertion and the
    issuance of black passes to municipal segregation and the prohibition of blacks from buying or renting
    land outside of designated zones, were put in place to prevent upward mobility and to promote
    unemployment among the native African communities.<br><br>
    These policies also, by necessity due to the growing ratio of poor black laborers to white owners and
    officials that by 1913 already more than doubled, created a distinct spatial separation of the groups
    by discouraging interracial interaction outside of the mines themselves - a spatial pattern strongly
    reinforced during the Apartheid era that followed. By the 1930’s, various black-only townships were
    established on cheap land as a result of forced reallocation. Until that point, the lack of adequate
    housing for Johannesburg’s vast working class resulted primarily in underserved, mixed-race
    shantytowns near the city center that have been earmarked for removal. The Great Depression then
    sparked a period of brief economic expansion, when the price of gold shot up due to the increase of
    global demand with the abandonment of the gold standard, providing the South African government with
    the funds necessary to separate and reallocate entire populations of black laborers. The largest
    resettlement became what is today the township of Soweto, located just south of the central business
    district, downwind from the massive mine dumps that divided the city. Here, land was cheap due to the
    lack of transportation infrastructure, and as a result of the environmental hazards of living near
    toxic waste dumps.<br><br>
    The next decades of Apartheid reinforced this pattern of isolating the wealthy, predominantly white
    community into well serviced and well developed urban areas upwind of the waste belt, and relegating
    the poor, black working class to sprawling shantytowns south - sometimes on top of the mounds
    themselves. And just as racial segregation was territorialized within the urban and periurban areas,
    the separation between urban and rural also became incredibly pronounced: stripping agricultural land
    of its male workers and leaving their families to be supported by low mine wages in effect created a
    dynamic where mine profits are maximized by policies that caused long term rural underdevelopment and
    poverty still in existence today.
</p>
<p id="body_title_minor">2.04<span class="tab"></span>Material erasure</p>
<p>
    South Africa’s economy, created from and dependent upon its gold mines, is now suffering from exhausted
    deposits, increasingly expensive excavations, and extreme groundwater and air pollution from the
    resulting waste. The large mining monopolies of the 20th century have dissolved into smaller South
    African enterprises that, with new and more advanced refinement technology, have begun to re-mine the
    waste dumps which contain small particulate gold unsuccessfully harvested in the century prior. Where
    the original commodification process left distinct spatial geographies as delineated by these waste
    dumps, their removal will instigate new dynamics within the urban and periurban fabric. Without process
    regulation, all of the generated wealth will continue to flow into global markets while the original
    mounds will be processed outside of the city and dumped in the periurban territory south of the low
    income communities. Due to the waste belt’s proximity to the central business district, and with the
    removal of waste leading to more favorable living conditions, the real estate value of the land will
    rapidly increase and the nearby communities will gentrify. This land will most likely be developed into
    higher income housing, and with the absence of biohazard waste to keep landvalue low, new urban lines
    will be drawn as the previous poor communities who lived on and around the mounds will eventually
    relocate even further outside the city to south of the new waste mounds.<br><br>
    Here is an opportunity for policy regulation and the built environment to respond to such a large
    scale re-extraction of natural resources: by fixing the waste in place and rehabilitating it, this
    power dynamic would be stabilized to create value for the poor communities while providing a buffer
    for the rich, thus generating a more even distribution of wealth between the two communities while
    maintaining urban densities. Thus the lesson from Johannesburg is through the material regulation of
    extractive processes to fix them in place, which would reduce the turbulence of the existing
    socioeconomic geography. By keeping the waste dumps where they are, but allowing for in situ
    infrastructural construction within them, the waste belt would be less of a wall and more of a
    mediator between the existing communities. The original infrastructural problem was a direct result
    of Johannesburg’s rapid materialization, at enormous scales due to global demand for gold. To avoid
    this mistake again, one must phase the remining process and allow it to happen heterogeneously
    through space and time.

<p>
    The instability of the gold standard is at its core based on the nature of commodification, where the
    separation of use value and exchange value enables a flip flopping between their relative strengths.
    The emergence of a gold standard thus coincided with the carving of new geographies of power, and each
    subsequent turbulence in value reverberated down its infrastructural pipelines to its territories of
    extraction and production. To effect change and to build resiliency into existing infrastructures, one
    must regulate the process by which material extraction proceeds into capital.<br><br>
    What can we learn from the infrastructural instabilities in Johannesburg as a result of the capital
    flow during the gold standard? In order to prevent the ad hoc rapid remining and large-scale
    redevelopment processes from destabilizing the socioeconomic structure of the city, one potential
    solution is to allow for the phasing of remining to occur concurrently with development at various
    stages over time, while also regulating the process to happen heterogenously in space. The era of
    centralized infrastructure is coming to an end; material stability must begin to rely on the
    redundancies of distributed systems to survive our faster future.

    “Isaura, city of the thousand wells, is said to rise over a deep, subterranean lake. On all sides,
    wherever the inhabitants dig long vertical holes in the ground, they succeed in drawing up water,
    as far as the city extends, and no farther. Its green border repeats the dark outline of the buried
    lake; an invisible landscape conditions the visible one; everything that moves in the sunlight is
    driven by the lapping wave enclosed beneath the rock’s calcareous sky.”
    <br>- Italo Calvino, Invisible Cities

    As systems-based thinking gradually reforms the domain of technical knowledge in the 21st century,
    architects largely continue to abstract the building as an object unto itself: distinct from and not
    beholden to the processes, materials, people, and consumptive forces with which every built structure
    is in dialogue. This erasure of material memory leads to an accumulation of infrastructural residue
    as old systems pass into obsolescence and extractive violence upon the landscape begins anew, leaving
    behind an unintentional city and blind inhabitants.<br><br>
    Birthed upon gold reefs, their mined detritus monumental within the urban fabric, Johannesburg is
    perfectly situated to negotiate processes of extraction with those of construction as these artificial
    mountains are now being hydrologically excavated for redevelopment. This project is a functional
    choreography of the regimens found in everyday life with the infrastructure of resource production -
    of water and gold - upon which these rituals are built, in an attempt to materialize through
    architectural agency the conditions of extraction that are typically unseen.
