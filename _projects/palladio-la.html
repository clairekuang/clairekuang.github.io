    “Tip the world on its side, and everything loose will land in Los Angeles.”
    <br>- Frank Lloyd Wright
</p>

<p>
    The narrative of 20th century Los Angeles begins with the formulation of a human ecology. As first
    generation immigrant colonies gestated within major metropolitan areas in the United States,
    sociologists predicted a race relation lifecycle of contact, competition, conflict, and ultimately
    a spatial assimilation as American suburbia slowly absorbed these foreign bodies. The stage was set
    for instability. Underneath the negotiations of territory and belonging in the decades that followed
    lay a theater of cultural identity and cultural (re)production, enacted by displaced individuals and
    communities asking the same, persistent question: ‘we are not from here - so who are we?’.<br><br>

    These moments of identity crisis and identity formation are captured in the small dramas of
    neighborhoods forced to become something culturally other. Take Olvera Street in downtown LA, 1930:
    home to a century-old Mexican community, poor, disadvantaged, rundown, and the perfect crucible for
    southern socialite Christine Sterling to test the commercial and touristic potency of a recently
    imported, romanticized Spanish Colonial Revival style. In a singular move that Ada Louise Huxtable
    would later describe as ‘the glorification of the unreal over the real’, a curiously American
    phenomenon driven by consumer obsession with iconic re-creations that appear more real than the
    original, Olvera rematerialized overnight not as authentically Mexican, but rather as a sort of
    Mexican kitsch, a shallow copy of terracotta tiles and stucco arches now considered to be Californian
    vernacular.<br><br>

    Cue Frederic Hsieh, a young and hotheaded Taiwanese American realtor dismissed by a distinctively
    affluent housing board for “coming into their living room and changing the furniture”, in his bid to
    convert the sparsely populated but predominantly white Monterey Park into a Chinese Beverly Hills.
    Hsieh dreamed of both resort and refuge for the Chinese during the 1970s, a time when East Asia was
    disintegrating, immigration quotas were expanding, and globalized trade took center stage on the
    national political agenda. Monterey Park and the neighboring San Gabriel Valley have since rapidly
    transformed into a constellation of decentralized ethnoburbs, immigrant growth machines that are
    spatially entangled and yet operationally liberated from their old suburban hosts. Within this
    recolonization resides a consumptive inheritance of Spanish Colonial structures erected by wealthy
    white Protestants, now garnished and ornamented with sometimes exclusively mandarin signage.<br><br>

    Los Angeles has never professed a singular spatial syntax, nor a coherent architectural grammar; it is
    a city assimilating in perpetuity, of make-believe homes owned by imposter inhabitants. Local
    structures, infrastructures, and superstructures are constantly redefined during acts of identity
    protest: the provisional non-Japanese repopulation of a vacant Little Tokyo during internment following
    the attack on Pearl Harbor in the 1940s; the blockbusting origins of black Compton born from
    fear-driven white flight in the 1960s, at a time where 90% of Los Angeles was legally restricted from
    African American residency; the violence of Rodney King riots rendering visible the informal boundaries
    of a vigilante Koreatown in the 1990s, self-patrolled with semi-automatics along storefronts and
    rooftops that made explicit the racial lines of a vandalized minority community. These iridescent
    upheavals leave behind houses, shopping centers, roads, town halls and churches like a shed husk,
    awkwardly fit to their incoming residents - fertile grounds for the invention of a new language of the
    commons, a migrant Order in a palimpsestic, self-masticating city where entire neighborhoods are
    digested, rewritten, and reborn in situ.<br><br>

    Palladio was no foreigner to socio-economic conflict. In sixteenth century Venice, food shortages and
    famine spurred by the Ottoman Empire’s seizure of former Venetian colonies prompted the city’s merchant
    elite to consolidate what was formerly communal agrarian territory in the neighboring Veneto and Verona.
    Tensions between the wealthy landowners and the disenfranchised peasants, who worked their now privately
    owned lands, were confined within the authoritative, hierarchical, and distinctly Italian language of
    the classically-trained architect; social instability was masked by idealized form, mathematically
    proportioned and symmetrically aligned. Thus the Palladian Villa is always, at its contextual and
    functional core, a negotiation between domesticity, public cultural identity, and agricultural
    production. The archetypical villa masses the private residential quarters at the focal point, insulated
    from the convulsing landscape by an exterior ring of subsidiary programs such as barns, stables, and
    service quarters - a spatial arrangement which suggests both dominion of and defense against a
    rapidly-changing geopolitics, by those who profited from instability. In the absence of grand civic
    buildings, Palladio’s villa serves as a domestic collective space for the gentrifying rural Veneto, a
    cross-section of servants, patricians, and their various guests, tied to their context by their origin
    as working farms.<br><br>

    Much like the fragmented territories of the Venetian colonies before Palladio, the disparate ethnoburbs
    of Los Angeles lack a symbolic and visual language of a Commons around which these volatile communities
    can articulate their cultural but situationally a-historic identities. However, rather than adopt a
    centralized, fortified, and rigid disposition, the suburban civic space must by necessity interface
    with its fluid residents and embrace its multiethnic heritage.<br><br>

    In this manner, the Veronese outlier Villa Serego is singular among the proposals of the Quattro Libri:
    instead of a domineering primary residential volume distended by smaller secondary and tertiary
    structures, the Serego instead captures, at its core, a void. Contained within is a courtyard, echoing
    the communal atria of ancient Roman dwellings, and a double portico as a vestibule to both the
    surrounding private quarters and a public-facing peristylium. This external courtyard is sliced open,
    flanked by two agricultural spaces, and idiosyncratically articulated by a heavily-rusticated Ionic
    colonnade which references the stylistic qualities of earlier Veronese buildings. Here the colonnade is
    our primary actor: it is the organizational interface between public and private, always present and
    negotiating between an intimate collective, the domicile, industry, and the open landscape. The
    mercurial quality of Villa Serego is further illustrated by its built history and bastardization of
    Palladio’s original design, spanning four centuries of broken construction - it is a synthetic
    narrative of partial ownerships and grafted styles, functioning intermittently as residence, farm, and
    winery, and persistently, through its open courtyards and colonnades, as a semi-public commons.<br><br>

    Andrea Palladio would model the inverted organization of Villa Serego for an ethnically regurgitating
    Angelino suburbia, using cultural ornament and the colonnade as a mediator between old and new. The
    productive commons now engages an ever-changing residential context through the additive layering of a
    migrant aesthetic upon existing architectural styles. He would graft the pastoral, bucolic Arkadía of
    Venice onto the modern day, bulimic Arcadia of the San Gabriel Valley. In the now predominantly Chinese
    and Latino ethnoburbs of East Los Angeles, the commons are no longer the traditional spaces of public
    authority - churches, government buildings, transit hubs and parks, but rather shift into the most
    productive bastion of cultural identity: commerce and cuisine. The unobtrusive yet quintessential corner
    shopping plaza, with family-owned restaurants and grocery stores sitting piecemeal like recalcitrant
    line cooks in a parking lot, within which residents both rich and poor from neighboring streets,
    neighboring towns, from across a hard, brutal Los Angeles, congregate underneath shaded overhangs until
    the moment of gathering, taking seat around home-style dishes from some foreign, yet uncannily familiar,
    land.<br><br>

    The asphalt courtyard, dotted with cars and crossed with columns, becomes the suburban place of public
    congregation. Distended porticos, dressed in Chinatown generic, mirror the haphazard partitioning of
    similarly ersatz colonial buildings - still clad with stucco arches and spanish tile - by their new
    inhabitants. The hand-me-down spaces, often poorly tailored, find structure from the negotiated grid,
    locally oriented and aligned to the urban fabric.Double colonnades expose the dual nature of
    consumption: a caustic city on one side and quiet residence on the other, while providing the pedestrian
    civic space that suburban communities desperately need. These roadside shopping plazas, restructured
    with public porticos, are ripe for a new, migrant order; they are humble portals between domicile and
    globalized commerce, garnishing the intersections of major throughways and local main streets, and
    stabilizing sites of conflict with the architectural ethos and prosthetic vernacular of an itinerant
    Los Angeles.
