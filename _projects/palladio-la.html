    “Tip the world on its side, and everything loose will land in Los Angeles.” (1)
</p>

<p>
    The narrative of 20th century Los Angeles begins with the formulation of a human ecology. As first 
    generation immigrant colonies gestated within major metropolitan areas in the United States, 
    sociologists predicted a race relation lifecycle of contact, competition, conflict, and ultimately 
    a spatial assimilation as American suburbia slowly absorbed these foreign bodies. The stage was set 
    for instability. Underneath the negotiations of territory and belonging in the decades that followed 
    lay a theater of cultural identity and cultural (re)production, enacted by displaced individuals and 
    communities asking the same, persistent question: “we are not from here - so who are we?”. Palladian 
    ideology, deeply rooted in the turbulent geopolitics of its own period, provides a particularly timely 
    framework through which Los Angeles may remediate its contextual amnesia and establish a sense of 
    place.<br><br>

    Los Angeles has never professed a singular spatial syntax, nor a coherent architectural grammar; it is 
    a city assimilating in perpetuity, of make-believe homes owned by imposter inhabitants. Local 
    structures, infrastructures, and superstructures are constantly redefined during acts of identity 
    protest: the provisional non-Japanese repopulation of a vacant Little Tokyo during internment 
    following the attack on Pearl Harbor in the 1940s; the blockbusting origins of black Compton born from 
    fear-driven white flight in the 1960s, at a time where ninety-five percent of Los Angeles had racially 
    restrictive covenants against minority residents; the violence of the Rodney King riots rendering 
    visible the informal boundaries of a vigilante Koreatown in the 1990s, self-patrolled with 
    semi-automatics along storefronts and rooftops that made explicit the racial lines of a vandalized 
    minority community (2). These iridescent upheavals leave behind houses, shopping centers, roads, town 
    halls and churches like a shed husk, awkwardly fit to their incoming residents: insecure in their own 
    heritage, they are fertile grounds for the reinvention of the commons, a migrant Order in a 
    palimpsestic, self-masticating city where entire neighborhoods are digested, rewritten, and reborn in 
    situ.<br><br>

    These moments of identity crisis and identity formation are captured in the small dramas of 
    neighborhoods forced to become something culturally other. Take Olvera Street in downtown LA, 1930: home 
    to a century-old Mexican community - poor, disadvantaged, rundown - and the perfect crucible for 
    southern socialite Christine Sterling to test the commercial and touristic potency of a recently 
    imported, romanticized Spanish Colonial Revival style. In a singular move that Ada Louise Huxtable would 
    later describe as “the glorification of the unreal over the real” (3), a curiously American phenomenon 
    driven by consumer obsession with iconic re-creations that appear more real than the original, Olvera 
    rematerialized overnight not as authentically Mexican, but rather as a sort of Mexican kitsch, a shallow 
    copy of terracotta tiles and stucco arches now considered to be Californian vernacular.<br><br>

    This was the architectural context in which Frederic Hsieh, a young and hotheaded Taiwanese American 
    realtor, found himself dismissed by a distinctly affluent housing board, which accused him of “trying to 
    come into their living room and changing the furniture” in his bid to convert the sparsely populated but 
    predominantly white Monterey Park into a Chinese Beverly Hills. As an alternative to the low-income, 
    densely populated urban Chinatown (4), Hsieh dreamed of both resort and refuge for the Chinese during the 
    1970s, a time when East Asia was disintegrating, immigration quotas were expanding, and globalized trade 
    took center stage on the national political agenda. As a result of his efforts, Monterey Park and the 
    nearby San Gabriel Valley have since rapidly transformed into a constellation of decentralized 
    ethnoburbs, immigrant growth machines that are spatially entangled and yet operationally liberated from 
    their old suburban hosts. Within this re-colonization resides a consumptive inheritance of Spanish 
    Colonial structures erected by wealthy white Protestants, now garnished and ornamented with sometimes 
    exclusively mandarin signage.<br><br>

    Palladio was no foreigner to socioeconomic conflict. In the sixteenth century, the Ottoman Empire’s 
    seizure of former Venetian colonies induced widespread food shortages and famines which prompted 
    Venice’s merchant elite to consolidate formerly communal agrarian territory in Veneto and Verona. 
    Tensions between the wealthy landowners and the disenfranchised peasants, who worked these now privately 
    owned lands, were subsumed within the authoritative, hierarchical, and distinctly Italian language of 
    the classically-trained architect: social instability was masked by idealized form, mathematically 
    proportioned and symmetrically aligned (5). Thus, the Palladian Villa is always, at its behavioral and 
    functional core, a negotiation between domesticity, public cultural identity, and agricultural 
    production. The archetypical villa masses the private residential quarters at the focal point, insulated 
    from the convulsing landscape by an exterior ring of subsidiary programs such as barns, stables, and 
    service quarters—a spatial arrangement which suggests both dominion of and defense against a rapidly 
    changing geopolitics. In the absence of grand civic buildings, Palladio’s villa serves as a domestic 
    collective space for the gentrifying rural Veneto, a cross-section of servants, patricians, and their 
    various guests, tied to their surroundings by their origin as working farms.<br><br>

    The Veronese outlier Villa Serego is singular among the proposals of the Quattro Libri: instead of a 
    domineering primary residential volume distended by smaller secondary and tertiary structures, the 
    Serego instead captures, at its core, a void. Contained within is a courtyard, echoing the communal 
    atria of ancient Roman dwellings, and a double portico as a vestibule to both the adjacent private 
    quarters and a public-facing peristylium. This external courtyard is sliced open, flanked by two 
    agricultural areas, and unconventionally lined with a heavily-rusticated Ionic colonnade which 
    references the stylistic qualities of earlier Veronese buildings. Here, the colonnade is our primary 
    actor: it is the organizational interface between public and private, always present and negotiating 
    between an intimate collective, the domicile, industry, and the open landscape. The mercurial quality 
    of Villa Serego is further illustrated by its built history and bastardization of Palladio’s original 
    design, spanning four centuries of broken construction. Serego is a synthetic narrative of partial 
    ownerships and grafted styles, functioning intermittently as residence, farm, and winery, and 
    persistently, through its open courtyards and colonnades, as a semi-public commons.<br><br>

    Much like the fragmented Venetian colonies before Palladio, the disparate ethnoburbs of Los Angeles 
    lack a symbolic and visual language of a Commons around which these volatile communities can articulate 
    their cultural but contextually agnostic identities. For an ethnically regurgitating Angelino suburbia, 
    the Palladian equivalent of Villa Serego must by necessity negotiate unreal heritages using ornament and 
    the colonnade as a mediator between old and new, and graft the pastoral, bucolic Arkadía of Veneto onto 
    the modern day, bulimic Arcadia of the San Gabriel Valley. In the now predominantly Chinese and Latino 
    ethnoburbs of East Los Angeles, these public spaces are no longer the traditional loci of authority - 
    churches, government buildings, transit hubs and parks - but rather shift into the most productive 
    bastions of cultural identity: commerce and cuisine. The suburban villa emerges de facto as the 
    quintessential corner shopping plaza, with family-owned restaurants and grocery stores sitting piecemeal 
    like recalcitrant line cooks in a parking lot, where residents rich and poor, from neighboring streets, 
    neighboring towns, from across a hard, brutal Los Angeles, congregate underneath shaded overhangs and 
    take seat around home-style dishes from some foreign, yet uncannily familiar land.<br><br>

    Instead of the cultural ecdysis that often accompanies radical shifts in development, the new commons 
    would resonate with an ever-changing residential population by layering migrant typologies upon existing 
    styles, and over time developing the patina of idiosyncratic assimilation. The diminutive Las Tunas Plaza 
    in San Gabriel, with its asphalt courtyard and row shops just slightly askew, is a perfect case study and 
    site of proposal for this architecture of accumulation. A simple addition of distended porticos, dressed 
    in Chinatown generic and emblazoned with neon hanzi, carefully sutures the language of its new 
    inhabitants onto buildings still clad with stucco arches and spanish tile. Each column mirrors the 
    haphazard partitioning of its ersatz colonial host, establishing a negotiated grid that gives structure 
    to these poorly tailored hand-me-down spaces, irregularly placed but now aligned to the urban fabric. 
    Double colonnades expose the dual nature of consumption: a caustic city on one side and quiet residences 
    on the other, while providing pedestrians the civic space that suburban communities desperately need. The 
    roadside shopping plaza, restructured with public porticos, is ripe for a new migrant order; unassuming 
    and plentiful, they are humble portals between domicile and globalized commerce, garnishing the 
    intersections of major throughways and main streets, and stabilizing sites of conflict with the 
    architectural ethos and prosthetic vernacular of an itinerant Los Angeles.<br><br>

    (1) Frank Lloyd Wright, on the creative looseness and cross pollination of styles within Southern 
    California. Perhaps also apropos to the ethnic origins of the city, traced back to 1781: of the 44 original 
    Pobladores selected by governor Felip De Neve, 26 were of African descent, 7 were Yang-Na Indians, and 9 of 
    mixed Spanish ancestry. Currently, of the major metropolitan cities worldwide, LA has the second largest 
    percentage of (documented) foreign-born residents (37.3%), with a non-white population of 48.6% (2018 US 
    Census).<br><br>

    (2) By 1910, Los Angeles had already primed the majority of its real estate with racially-restrictive 
    covenants. Curiously, mansionization of single family homes developed in response to this induced housing 
    shortage, such that prices could be increased vis a vis increasing square footage. Architectural critic Ada 
    Louis Huxtable describes these McMansions as “a grotesque aggregate of Rapunzel towers, pretend Palladian, 
    Jacuzzis and surround-sound”.<br><br>

    (3) The Unreal America: Architecture and Illusion, The New Press: 1991. Huxtable declares architecture to 
    be relentlessly self-referential, where cumulative heritage underlies even the most radical breaks from 
    style. She lambasts the term “authentic reproduction” as deceptively ahistorical, and differentiates the 
    real fakes from the fake fakes, selecting LA’s own Frank Gehry as a beacon of stylistic authenticity: 
    coincidentally, even he succumbed to Disney CEO Michael Eisner’s architectural imagineering and designed a 
    themed minimall on which he later commented, regretfully, “I lost control.”<br><br>

    (4) The newly minted Chinatown was a product of Hollywood set designers, and professed the stylistically 
    flat, one dimensional mise-en-scène of eastern exoticism intentionally commodified as an ethnic signifier: 
    this was an effort by the recovering Chinese community to rebrand themselves as a culturally coherent and 
    digestible destination.<br><br>

    (5) Mimar Sinan (1490 - 1588), royal architect to the Ottoman Empire, was familiar with the Renaissance 
    ideas of Alberti and also strove for ideal forms through geometric perfection. He shared a contact with 
    Palladio via his patron Marcantonio Barbaro, a Venetian senator who served as bailo of Constantinople for 
    six years: their mutual influences can be seen in the elevations of Sinan’s mosques post publication of 
    the Quattro Libri and in the spires of Palladio’s Chiesa del Redentore.
