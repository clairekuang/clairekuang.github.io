<p id="quote_text">"...With recognition of the protean nature of meaning-making; that the message of “waste”,
    “warning”, “storage”, and “communication” are all approached through a perambulating gestalt
    birthed through the loose affinities between objects both monumental and mundane. These objects and
    their assemblage, drawing gravitas from their multiplicity and material immunity from their functional
    obsolescence, are simultaneously the natural detritus of civilizations past and the nascent typologies
    of those yet to come. These follies! They are the quivering sextants by which we will navigate the ebbs
    and flows of the nuclear in our collective history..."

<p id="body_title_major">NUCLEAR WASTE: BRIEF</p>
<p>
    Since the Cold War, one of the most challenging and urgent tasks facing governments around the world
    has been the disposal of transuranic nuclear waste. As a byproduct from nuclear weaponry production,
    transuranic waste is not only harmful, but also boasts a formidable decay process lasting thousands
    of years. To address this issue, millions of barrels of highly radioactive waste have been buried in
    repositories deep beneath the earth's surface. One such disposal site is the Waste Isolation Pilot
    Plant (WIPP) in New Mexico, United States. To ensure public safety, it is imperative that the site
    remain undisturbed for the duration of the waste's decay process.<br><br>

    CHALLENGE: design a marker or marker system to deter inadvertent human intrusion into the Waste
    Isolation Pilot Plant. The marker should exist as a means of passive institutional control of the site
    for the duration of 10,000 years, following the closure and deactivation of the WIPP. The purpose of
    the marker is to communicate with future generations that transuranic waste is buried within a
    repository at the facility, located 2,150 feet beneath its surface, and should remain isolated until
    the risks posed by its release have been sufficiently diminished.

    "We don’t want to conquer space at all. We want to expand Earth endlessly.
    We don’t want other worlds; we want a mirror."<br>- Dr. Snaut, Solaris<br><br>

    the disappearance of what I might have seen, but failed to see."<br>- Levi Strauss, Tristes Tropiques<br><br>

    "Always new products - the other, invisible side of capitalism is waste. Tremendous amounts of waste.
    We shouldn’t react to these heaps of waste by somehow trying to get rid of it; maybe the first thing
    to do is to accept this waste, to accept that there are things out there which serve nothing. To break
    out of this eternal cycle of functioning."<br>- Slavoj Zizek, Pervert’s Guide to Ideology<br><br>

<p>
    Is it possible to anticipate the semiotics of "warning" over the course of ten millenia of sentient life?
    Rather than to attempt to design a single form which carries with it this element of danger and caution, we
    operate with the understanding that the objects of meaning-making have always been and will always continue to
    fluctuate in how they convey signifiers, in their means of production and manufacture, and in their varying 
    degrees of usefulness/uselessness. It is not the obelisk that functions as marker universal; it is the traffic
    cone-
