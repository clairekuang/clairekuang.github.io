<p id="body_title_minor">1.01<span class="tab"></span>A conversation with coach Vic</p>
<p>
    When Victor Acosta started his own Muay Thai gym 8 years ago, he had no idea what he was doing. He came 
    from one of those old Angeleño communities, where everyone spoke spanish and moved with slow honeyed 
    limbs - the kind of Van Nuys suburbia where you didn't start your own business, and you didn't know 
    anyone who did, either. In the years that followed, full of the 
    use-it-till-it-breaks-and-then-use-it-for-a-bit-longer,  learn-on-your-feet-and-figure-it-out, 
    watch-your-gym-burn-down-and-start-over-again kind of stories, coach Vic managed to patch together what 
    is now a thriving cross section of community that is starting to outgrow the small 900sqft gym nestled 
    in the corner of Venice and MacLaughlin.<br><br> 
   
    A couple of months into my membership, I sat down with Vic at a nearby coffee shop to talk brand. I 
    wanted to understand what it was about this local gym, its windows always fogged over with exertion and 
    ringing with the staccato sounds of pads depleting, that drew me into a sport which appeared so 
    intimidating to the uninitiated and has since become both routine and ritual. Technique over power - 
    rhythm, flow, precision,  a clean and fluid style that is executed with more grace than aggression. 
    Approachable, but professional.

<p id="body_title_minor">1.02<span class="tab"></span>Artistic aspirations</p>
<p>
    On the side, Vic also fronts a small 3-piece punk rock band with two other members from the gym. Having 
    grown up firmly under the influence of sounds from The Smiths, Real Estate, and z, Vic has tapped into 
    the punk rock mentality of resourcefulness and indie anti-establishment attitute that he wants to bring 
    into his gym's graphic presentation. He wants to avoid the typical symbols of boxing and competitive gyms, 
    with their violent reds and victory blues, with kicking silhouettes and swinging gloves. He pulls up 
    Takasan's curated instagram account of old school muay thai posters: 3D pink word art headlines over a 
    faded fighter clad in puffy periwinkle shorts, yellow ochre gradients and kitschy perspective distorted 
    backdrops, compositionally patchwork and endearingly earnest.

<p>
    PLACEHOLDER TEXT: First impressions of the gym. Avoiding the most commonly associated symbol of boxing - the boxing glove, and the typical aggressive colors
    of competitive gyms (violent red, black, blue). Instead, focused on the dualisms of martial arts: precision, technique, and science of fighting represented through an axonometric, dissected boxing
    ring. Ritual, rhythm, and flow represented by the handwrap. Muted solids and vared color scheme with captures the makeshift do-it-yourself attitude while
    remaining grounded and professional.
