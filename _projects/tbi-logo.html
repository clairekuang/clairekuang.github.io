<p id="body_title_minor">1.01<span class="tab"></span>A conversation with coach Vic</p>
<p>
    When Vic Acosta started his own Muay Thai gym 8 years ago, he had no idea what he was doing. He came
    from one of those old Angele√±o communities, where everyone spoke spanish and moved with slow honeyed
    limbs - the kind of Van Nuys suburbia where you didn't start your own business, and you didn't know
    anyone who did, either. In the years that followed, full of the
    use-it-till-it-breaks-and-then-use-it-for-a-bit-longer,  learn-on-your-feet-and-figure-it-out,
    watch-your-gym-burn-down-and-start-over-again kind of stories, coach Vic managed to patch together what
    is now a thriving cross section of community that is starting to outgrow the small 1400sqft gym nestled
    in the corner of Venice and MacLaughlin.<br><br>

    A couple of months into my membership, I sat down with Vic at a nearby coffee shop to talk brand. It was
    an opportunity to engage in a more personal kind of design, to try and articulate what it was about this
    local gym, its windows always fogged over with exertion and ringing with the staccato sounds of pads
    depleting, that so effectively drew me in to a sport - intimidating to the uninitiated - that has since
    become both routine and ritual.

<p>
    On the side, Vic also fronts a small 3-piece rock band with two other members from the gym. Having
    grown up firmly under the influence of sounds from The Arctic Monkeys, Elliott Smith, and Circa Survive,
    Vic taps into the punk rock mentality of anti-establishment resourcefulness: an attitude reflected in
    the gym's graphic presentation. Avoiding the typical symbols of boxing and competitive gyms,
    with their violent reds and victory blues, with kicking silhouettes and swinging gloves, he pulls up
    Takasan's curated instagram account of old school muay thai posters for inspiration. We glimpse 3D pink 
    word-art headlines over a faded fighter clad in puffy periwinkle shorts, yellow ochre gradients and kitschy 
    perspective distorted backdrops, and a poorly cut-out silhouette that is both compositionally patchwork 
    and endearingly earnest. "I've been really into pastels", he notes, "but more professional".

<p id="body_title_minor">1.03<span class="tab"></span>The Ring and the Wrap</p>
<p>
    Vic's attitude towards muay thai as a martial art encapsulates his approach to teaching: he emphasizes 
    technique over power, grace over aggression, and impresses deeply the foundational impact of always 
    being aware of oneself and one's orientation relative to others. This presence of mind and economy of movement
    translates into concise, strategically contextual, and clear demonstrations. Carefully observing each 
    student's stance, he makes small adjustments for radically more impactful strikes, and creates thoughtful 
    combinations where the chaining of weight shifts leaves no breath wasted and no trajectory without purpose.

<p>
    To symbolize these qualities of precision, technique, and rhythm, I chose not the boxing glove, but the handwrap 
    as the design basis for TBI's main logo. The wrap functions as the substructure that gives articulation to the 
    hand when clenched, keeping fingers distinct and separated upon impact, joining the hand and the wrist as a single
    vector extending from turned ankle to engaged core before terminating in the arm outstretched. Above all, it is in 
    the small, studied moments of preparation, the unrolling of wraps and idiosyncratic, repeated layering of fabric 
    over and around and between the contours of the hand, that one finds ritual in the practice of martial arts.

<p>
    The construction of the wrap logo focuses on clean curves and hard lines to convey the dualities in Vic's
    gym motto, "the art of striking and the science of fitness". Each letter connects with the next to convey flow without
    losing the technicality of intermediary lines decorating the handwrap fabric. Muted solids and a varied color scheme
    captures the charm of eclecticism while remaining grounded and professional, while conversion to a high contrast black 
    and white emphasizes the form of the logo in a more universal representation of the Thai Boxing Institute.
