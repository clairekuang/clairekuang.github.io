<p>
    In the spring of 2017, Benzi, Anna, and I took an elective class on ceramics, as a much-needed counterbalance 
    to and respite from the intesity of thesis. With emphasis on material studies and form fabrication, we quickly
    became fascinated by the extreme differences in cost, labor, and percieved artistic value of ceramic objects 
    occupying the two ends of the consumer spectrum, despite the underlying similarity of material.

    On one side sits the glossy, dappled, suggestively amorphous solid clay sculptures of native Angeleno Ken 
    Price, their bespoke finishes produced through the time-intensive, labor-intensive process of hand sanding 
    dozens of layers of meticulously applied acrylic and lacquer, with a sticker price falling upwards of $200,000. 
    On the other, made in mass and bought in bulk, unscrupulously generic and ubiquitously deployed, lie your 
    terracotta roof tiles, Spanish S, readily available for $4.72 per square foot at Home Depot. 
</p>
<p>
    At a trading rate by weight at 5-8 tiles per sculpture, does the additive cultural and consumer value of Price's 
    sculptures really appreciate the underlying ceramic material by 1000%? The sculptural object - complex in form 
    but simplistic in its 'assembly' from a single block of clay - is perfect foil to the Spanish tile's standardized 
    shape in a comprehensive catalogue of specific parts. For every gabled intersection, ridge joint, dormer window, 
    exhaust pipe, and end cap condition there is a tile. Their extruded forms are functionally driven and assembled 
    over conventional roofs: an underlying methodology of construction that leaves room for the exuberance of 
    expression captured in Price's sculptural works without compromising the tectonic performance of standardized 
    production.

<p>
    To us, a Ken Price x Home Depot collaboration would see the rules, regulations, and dimensions of tile construction 
    re-imagined for curved roofs that approach their own bespoke sculptural quality at distance, on the scale of the 
    assembly rather than the clay unit. Without changing the standardized production of the terracotta S tiles, which 
    are extruded from a milled plastic die and cut into fixed lengths, we allow for a small consistent angle deviations 
    in how the tiles overlap when they are nailed together. Propagated over several rows, the points at which these 
    tiles are fixed can be extrapolated into curves which describe a ruled surface. The punchline becomes a structural 
    moir√©, where the skewed grid of the substrate to which the tiles are affixed is then layered obliquely across their 
    supporting beams, obfuscating the construction logic of the overall assembly. This system of tile to substrate to 
    beam is flexible enough to accomodate a range of ruled and flat surface variations, capable of generating an entire 
    taxonomy of roof-objects.

    In ceramic roof construction, forms are limited by the complexity of standardized tiles and the assembly of their
    scaffolding. They are particularly good at cladding gabled roofs, as they are just tilted planes. However, there exist
    singly-curved geometries such as conic turrets and cylindrical barrel vaults, which can be undrolled into courses
    without distortion. This project exploits the combination of flat to singly-curved geodesic surfaces while using an
    "off-the-shelf" building technique: an assembly of linear beams and curvilinear ribs which are spaced for diagonally-
    coursing tiles.

    "Price carefully begins to sand the surface of the painted sculpture. As the sandpaper removes the paint from the
    high points of grog, the first buried color appears. Further sanding reveals deeper layers of the stratified paint.
    Violet surrounds orange, which surrounds blue - all at a jewel-like scale. Price sands an area down to a point where
    the color array seems right and then proceeds to sand down every square inch of the piece to exactly the same layer.
    The result is a modulated array of colors that seems to have emerged through a natural, non-human process."
</p>
<p>
    Price laboriously prepares the surfaces of his sculptures with a variety of instruments, resembling dental tools, 
    before sponging down the clay to reveal hard bits of ceramic. Each sculpture is coated in about fourteen layers of 
    acrylic, which in combination with the grog reveal varying gradations of color schemes when sanded. Our low-fi 
    finish simplifies this process into 5 coats of underglaze in cyclical order, so that similar hues are at times 
    adjacent and at times sandwiching brighter complimentary colors, to enhance each tile's depth and vibrance in an 
    Albersian mode of changing the perception of a hue simply by virtue of shifting its neighboring color context. The 
    top layer is dominant in the scheme, with the secondary layer as the main highlight color that is exposed during 
    the sanding process. Each color thereafter adds subtle contrasting tones to these top two layers.
</p>
<p>
    Without the curved surface geometry of Price's sculptural forms to reveal subtle variations in color erasure, we 
    settled on fast-paced process of spot-sanding multiple tiles simultaneously with a sand blaster. On the level of 
    the assembly, metaball scripts produce many variations that emulate the voluptuousness of Price's sculptures and 
    replicate the mottled effect on a macro level.

<p id="body_title_major">ONE NIGHT ONLY</p>
<p>
    The second inaugural Dopium LA event, thematically titled ["DIMENSIONS"], was a one night only multi-sensory 
    art exhibition at the A + D Museum in downtown LA. Originally marked for the Mandarin Plaza in Chinatown, the
    brief called for a site-specific showcase of cultural experiences and stories that have informed our foundations 
    as artists. Our project, already inheriting from the built typology of the Spanish Colonial Revival style and 
    the Los Angeles ceramic art movement, turned to the iconic tiling of Chinatown roofs and their neon-emblazoned 
    gateways to set the scene for Dopium LA.
</p>

<p id="body_title_minor">2.01<span class="tab"></span>Chinatown Colonial</p>
<p>
    Chinatown as we see it today was the playground and product of Hollywood set designers in the 1930s, 
    intentionally flat in its architectural expression and saturated with the mise en sc√®ne of eastern exoticism. 
    Through the decades, these shallow copies of traditional vernacular began to adopt a language of their own 
    through various permutations of form and finish, with blazing neon silhouettes running along curved ang beaks 
    and ridged ceramic tiles, each serving as pure ornament against a backdrop of stylized facades. It is this 
    spirit of vernacular expression - one that is protean, one-dimensional, and impermanent by nature - in which 
    we find discourse.
</p>
<p>
    We want to mine these influences to offer future narratives for the rich appliqu√© of ceramics across the built 
    environment. From the terracotta roofs of Spanish Colonial Revival homes, to their geometric and colorful 
    transformations across Chinatown, mixed in with the finish techniques of LA-based ceramics artist Ken Price, 
    we hope to layer these methods of both high and low cultural production to forge new conversations between the 
    surrounding tiled roofs and a more comprehensive understanding of their sources. As a cross section of Southern 
    California aesthetic traditions, our prototype borrows these techniques to create a more synthetic vernacular 
    expression in the Mandarin Plaza.

    As a group of designers, we are attuned to the imaginative potential of these forms and the make-believe
    environments they evoke. Our proposal, originally slated to sit on the roof of an adjacent building, found its
    home slumped over a seating bench in a domesticated scene that emphasized mood through lighting as day turned 
    into one night only at A + D.
