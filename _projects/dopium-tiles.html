<p id="body_title_major">KEN PRICE, HOME DEPOT</p>
<p>
    Los Angeles is a city of make-believe, saturated with shallow copies of the built environments of its 
    migrant populations: vernaculars which are protean, one-dimensional, and impermanent by nature. From 
    the terracotta roofs of Spanish Colonial Revival homes to the neon-lined tiles of Chinatown, emblazoned
    with the finish techniques of ceramics artist Ken Price, Tiles Over... is a cross section of Southern
    California aesthetic traditions for one night only at A+D museum.

<p id="body_title_minor">1.03<span class="tab"></span>Material mediators</p>
<p>
    In this discourse, the term ‘infrastructure’ exists purely in relation to the flows that enable capital
    accumulation through the production and consumption of commodities. Maria Kaika and Erik Swyngedouw
    identify technological networks as the “material mediators between nature and the city; they carry the
    flow and process of transformation of one into the other”. The process of assigning market relations to
    socially metabolized goods is fundamentally dependent on the process of fetishization, which in the
    Marxist sense is the quantification of the qualitative that allows for abstraction to take over. The
    fetishized commodity supplies its own ideology in the market, and allows for augmentations of its
    exchange value without revealing the socioenvironmental circumstances of its production.
</p>
<p id="body_title_minor">1.04<span class="tab"></span>First monumental, then mundane</p>
<p>
    Commodity fetishism in the modern era merged economics, politics, and culture to materially
    enact an ideology of progress, resulting in behemoth infrastructures which served as monuments
    to engineering and technological progress. In the span of a decade from 1904-1914, the
    construction of the Panama Canal resulted in the excavation of more than 130 million cubic meters
    of earth. The Great Depression gave birth to the Hoover Dam, impounding Lake Mead for
    hydroelectric power and containing more than 3.3 million cubic meters of concrete. These
    megastructures operated at a scale unfathomable to the human body, iconic in both size and impact.
    With the abandonment of this techno-optimist ideology following the abysmal living conditions
    characteristic of post-industrial cities and the mechanical destruction of the two world wars,
    came the erasure of urban networks from visible, physical space; a transition from the monumental
    to the mundane. Contemporary urban infrastructures are invisible: pipes, cables, electronic waves
    that sever the connection between the social transformation of nature and the process of
    urbanization. In this sense, physical infrastructures are the residue, the material byproducts of
    the process of capitalism, viewed only as instruments in the service of additional value
    extraction, and can be extended to include the material city itself - and embedded in this
    material manifestation are power dynamics which facilitate the flow of capital, often in service
    of those with purchasing wealth. In our globalized economy, these flows transcend geographic and
    political boundaries, directionally fixed from sites of extraction to territories of mass consumption.

<p id="body_title_minor">1.05<span class="tab"></span>Infrastructure in motion</p>
<p>
    Here we stumble upon a fundamental paradox of capital as it relates to infrastructure: how does one
    reconcile the dynamism of capital in perpetual motion and fluctuation with infrastructur that is
    static and immobile in space? One could argue that this tension manifests as the creative destruction
    of the built environment and ceaseless restructuring of scale economies, characteristic of the
    cityscape in advanced capitalism. Instability, in the urban context, thus occurs when a paradigm shift
    in capital flow commands a radical restructuring of the physical infrastructures that must adjust to
    enable its realization. From this several questions arise: how does the erratic flow of capital affect
    the colonization of nature? How can one intervene in the static, built environment to influence these
    flows, either to stabilize or stimulate its corresponding capitalist system? How will infrastructure’s
    legacy manifest itself both materially and aesthetically upon future cityscapes?<br><br>
    Identifying infrastructures as being primary, secondary, or tertiary respective to its corresponding
    role in extraction, commodification, and information distribution, then commodification with the
    emergence of late capitalism shows tertiary infrastructures with ever increasing scale and scope,
    inversely related to their presence in physical space. The long timescales and inertia of built
    infrastructure, when contrasted with the immediacy and rapid evolution of digital information and
    boom/bust cycles poses significant point of investigation for this project. In looking at the
    post-industrial evolution of currency from the gold standard to the digital, we can perhaps draw some
    conclusions about how modern societies can develop resiliency in the face of rapid capital flows as we
    mature through the age of information.
</p>
<p id="body_title_minor">1.06<span class="tab"></span>The Gold Standard</p>
<p>
    Arguably the most classically transformative paradigm shift in the history of currency, the
    establishment of a formal gold standard among the major trading nations during the 19th century reveal
    the scale and scope to which capital flows can reshape the urban and its subsidiary landscape. Gold has
    existed as a form of currency since as early as 610BC, but it wasn’t until the era of colonization and
    rapidly expanding global markets that the  metal became incongruously cumbersome to transport across
    vast distances. Where before the value of the gold coin was embedded in the material of the coin
    itself, the introduction of the gold standard allowed for a more efficient representation of value - in
    this case, paper currency - that was still fixed upon some definite quantity of gold.<br><br>
    This new mode of representation not only facilitated the global trade by establishing trust between
    governments which could redeem any amount of paper money for its value in gold, but it also kickstarted
    a global feedback loop between gold mines, gold markets, and government. Burgeoning multinational trade
    heightened demand for gold to back the standards in the US and Europe, especially gold which could be
    mined as cheaply as possible to maximize the profits of colonizing nations. In turn, as their wealth
    grew so too did the volume of trade, propelling the demand for gold ever higher. Britain was the first
    to adopt a gold specie standard in 1821, followed by the United States and Germany in 1873.
</p>
<p id="body_title_minor">1.07<span class="tab"></span>Critical instabilities</p>
<p>
    This system, however, proved unstable as each injection of new gold into these economies also meant a
    drop in the value of gold and their corresponding currencies. Instability reached critical thresholds
    with the advent of the first world war, when the standard was suspended to enable bulk printing of
    paper currency to fund military involvement - instigating a period of hyperinflation as the value of
    currency was no longer stabilized to a regulated material form. The standard failed once again during
    the Great Depression, as investors began trading in currencies which subsequently raised the value of
    gold and promoted widespread hoarding during the fallout of trust in American banking institutions
    following the stock market crash. An equally powerful counterswing instigated by Roosevelt, in an
    attempt to stymy depletion, then resulted in the largest global consolidation of gold stock in the
    Federal Reserve. Because of this majority share, the US dollar had become the de facto world currency
    by the 1944 Bretton Woods Agreement, which fixed all exchange values in terms of gold.<br><br>
    This marked the beginning of a new dynamic in gold’s role as a commodity: where before its use value
    lay in the ease with which it could be liquidated (exchanged for cash), this function has now been
    replaced by cash itself. Instead of stockpiling gold, other countries began stockpiling the US dollar,
    thus turning a paper currency into a commodity, where its value is not fixed to some quantifiable
    material but rather to the scale and scope in which it is used. Though the gold standard officially
    ended on August 15, 1971 when the ballooning value of the US dollar due to its role as the linchpin
    of the world economy could no longer be backed by its gold reserves, and the Fed could no longer
    redeem dollars with gold, the metal continues to embody an asset of real value in the global social
    conscience, as exemplified in its purchase during periods of recession and inflation.

<p id="body_title_major">CITY OF GOLD</p>
<p>
    The ramifications of a globalized gold market as geopolitical infrastructure at the source of extraction
    and production are profound. A fascinating dive into the gold supply chain during the first four decades
    of the 20th century pinpoint the Transvaal region of South Africa as the supplier of 35% of the world’s
    gold production, and the approximately 50,000 tons of gold extracted since the end of the 19th century
    account for almost half of all gold ever mined through the course of human history. The transformations
    in this area, in particular the rapid conversion of a primarily agrarian society into the largest and
    richest metropolis of South Africa and the violence exacted upon its land and people, are inextricably
    tied to the politics behind the establishment and subsequent turbulences of the gold standard.

<p id="body_title_minor">2.01<span class="tab"></span>As Above, So Below</p>
<p>
    In the summer of 1886, prospectors struck gold on a small farm called Langlaate. This was the
    Witwatersrand Reef, which extends east-west for 400 kilometers and runs for some 5,000 meters below
    ground. Soon prospectors and migrant workers came and set up small mining camps wherever gold was
    struck, and Langlaate merged with clusters of other camps to form what is now the city of Johannesburg.
    Growth was explosive: in the year following discovery, the Reef in its entirety was estimated to
    contain some 7,000 people, less than half of which lived in Johannesburg itself. Not four years later,
    Johannesburg’s population had multiplied ten-fold, and by 1891 approximately 102,000 people resided in
    the city. The circumstances of Johannesburg’s formation, and the exponential growth that followed, is
    written permanently into the urban fabric. Previous gold discoveries in the Transvaal were all alluvial
    and thus transient in nature, and so the original subdivision of land in Johannesburg’s first camp
    clusters were closely spaced, typical of 19th century mine camp planning. By the time it became known
    that the Reef ran both deep and wide, the burgeoning class of migrant workers had already drawn lawyers,
    shopkeepers, and traders that converted the camps into more permanent buildings, crystallizing the
    original partition scheme into what is now Johannesburg’s central business district.<br><br>
    Transportation and other infrastructures materialized quickly within this period, with piped water,
    electricity, and telephones appearing in the first two years, and South Africa’s first railway system
    inaugurated by the beginning of 1890. Initially servicing the predominant east-west run of the Reef,
    these infrastructures soon had to negotiate the mining waste dumps, sometimes deposited just meters
    away from the mine entrances due to the initial ad hoc zoning restrictions, that resulted from a shift
    into deep-level mining after surface outcrops ran low. The problem of waste was further exacerbated by
    the low grade ore that characterized much of the Witwatersrand Reef, with some companies producing up to
    200,000 times as much waste as gold: an issue that only worsened as time progressed and deeper
    excavations were made to reach new deposits.
