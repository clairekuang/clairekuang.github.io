<p>
    Stadium, Selvedged is an infrastructural proposal: a radical reduction of traditional stadiums into
    framed canopies that double as grandstands, resting delicately upon an excavated field for the lightest
    material footprint. Each petal is staged piecemeal, left raw, unfinished in perpetuity to adapt to the
    changing programmatic needs of a rapidly urbanizing Lagos.<br><br>
    Stitched together from construction waste - lumber reworked into idiosyncratic glulam beams, concrete
    rubble piled into landscape berms - the irregular shape and patchwork quality of Stadium, Selvedged
    signifies the proposal as a byproduct of the city while exposing the bespoke craftsmanship of a
    world-class stadium.
