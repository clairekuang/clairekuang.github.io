                            Projects have no end. They are methodologies from the moment of their inception, little potentials of energy with the capacity to *do work*, path-dependant vectors of intent and implementation.
                            This compedium is an archive of projects that bring together context, research, form, and effect as a synthetic narrative - drawing tools and technologies as needed, 
                            irreverent to discipline, exuberantly wip.

                            Stadium, Selvedged is an infrastructural proposal: a radical reduction of traditional stadiums into 
                            framed canopies that double as grandstands, resting delicately upon an excavated field for the lightest 
                            material footprint. Each petal is staged piecemeal, left raw, unfinished in perpetuity to adapt to the 
                            changing programmatic needs of a rapidly urbanizing Lagos.<br><br>
                            Stitched together from construction waste - lumber reworked into idiosyncratic glulam beams, concrete 
                            rubble piled into landscape berms - the irregular shape and patchwork quality of Stadium, Selvedged 
                            signifies the proposal as a byproduct of the city while exposing the bespoke craftsmanship of a 
                            world-class stadium.

                        <p>
                            Since the Cold War, one of the most challenging and urgent tasks facing governments around the world 
                            has been the disposal of transuranic nuclear waste. As a byproduct from nuclear weaponry production, 
                            transuranic waste is not only harmful, but also boasts a formidable decay process lasting thousands 
                            of years. To address this issue, millions of barrels of highly radioactive waste have been buried in 
                            repositories deep beneath the earth's surface. One such disposal site is the Waste Isolation Pilot 
                            Plant (WIPP) in New Mexico, United States. To ensure public safety, it is imperative that the site 
                            remain undisturbed for the duration of the waste's decay process.<br><br>
                            
                            CHALLENGE: design a marker or marker system to deter inadvertent human intrusion into the Waste 
                            Isolation Pilot Plant. The marker should exist as a means of passive institutional control of the site 
                            for the duration of 10,000 years, following the closure and deactivation of the WIPP. The purpose of 
                            the marker is to communicate with future generations that transuranic waste is buried within a 
                            repository at the facility, located 2,150 feet beneath its surface, and should remain isolated until 
                            the risks posed by its release have been sufficiently diminished.

                        <p>
                            The narrative of post-industrial capital, in so far as it is capable of transforming at scale the 
                            material landscape of wealth into self- reinforcing structures of organization and power, is reaching 
                            a critical point with the advent of modern urbanization. As succinctly surmised by Mark Weiser in his 
                            1991 essay in Scientific American, “the most profound technologies are those that disappear...they 
                            weave themselves into the fabric of everyday life until they are indistinguishable from it”. 
                            Contemporary infrastructures in this sense are radically reshaping the processes, politics, and 
                            aesthetics of commodification and commodity fetishization that have been the hallmark of capital 
                            accumulation in the 20th century. In looking at the material foundation of capital and currency 
                            following the industrial revolution, this thesis nosedives into the relationship between power, capital, 
                            and the built environment through a case study of the global dynamics surrounding the implementation of 
                            the gold standard in the early 1800’s, and the unprecedented metamorphosis of Johannesburg’s urban 
                            landscape that resulted in the following century.

                        <p id="body_title_minor">1.01<span class="tab">Value, in perpetuity</p>
                        <p>
                            To situate the terms ‘capital’, ‘commodity’, and ‘infrastructure’ within a Marxist framework, capital 
                            is defined as the accumulation of wealth specifically through the process of circulation - a dynamic 
                            driven by the difference between a commodity’s use value and its exchange value. The capitalist then 
                            understands this value as being in constant motion, where profit is generated through perpetual 
                            reinvestment and consequent augmentation of exchange value. The nature of this value-added exchange is 
                            then contextualized through how one chooses to define the term ‘commodity’; and indeed, the chasm 
                            between commodity as it first appears in Das Kapital and as it is currently understood in the global 
                            markets is quite extensive. To Marx, commodity was “an object outside us, a thing that by its 
                            properties satisfies human wants of some sort or another”, and where “the nature of such wants, whether, 
                            for instance, they spring from the stomach or from fancy, makes no difference...neither are we here 
                            concerned to know how the object satisfies these wants, whether directly as means of subsistence, or 
                            indirectly as means of production”. This definition is metaphysical in disposition, and is concerned 
                            less with the tangible qualifications by which a specific externality is commodified than it is with 
                            the understanding that commodification is a process implicitly tied to human desire. As such, desire 
                            being a fickle beast, the commodity is monadic as a unit endowed with perceptual virtue, and it is this 
                            appended quality that gains in value through transformations of exchange by social and political forces.
                        </p>
                        <p id="body_title_minor">1.02<span class="tab">Consumptive futures</p>
                        <p>
                            Contemporary economics, however, defines the commodities trade far more tangibly: such objects are 
                            typically uniform in pricing across many markets, are used in the production of othergoods, and can be 
                            extracted or grown and traded in sufficiently high quantities. These traits allow them to support 
                            extremely liquid markets in which futures and options are often sold to protect both producers and 
                            consumers against fluctuations in price. In this context, the commodity necessarily exists on a global 
                            scale, and its value in trade is defined not by a consistent growth in exchange value but rather by the 
                            ease with which they can be converted into money through their use in other, more refined products. 
                            Thus cocoa, copper, wheat, oil, and coal qualify whereas diamonds, due to their inconsistencies in 
                            quality, and natural gas, due to its predisposition for price determination through long term regional 
                            contracts, do not. The modern commodity exists in material form only briefly; its primary purpose is to 
                            be liquidated as quickly as possible for as much as possible. The selling of futures - the functional 
                            equivalent of the Marxist exchange value - is now complete in its disembodiment from the physical 
                            realities of the object itself, acting as a stand-in independent from the actual volume of material 
                            being extracted or produced. Where the Marxist perspective portrays the commodity as an object with 
                            appended metaphysical value, in perpetual circulation, the economics of today suggest they are transient 
                            one-way pipelines from production at scale to diversified, globalized consumption.

                            In this discourse, the term ‘infrastructure’ exists purely in relation to the flows that enable capital 
                            accumulation through the production and consumption of commodities. Maria Kaika and Erik Swyngedouw 
                            identify technological networks as the “material mediators between nature and the city; they carry the 
                            flow and process of transformation of one into the other”. The process of assigning market relations to 
                            socially metabolized goods is fundamentally dependent on the process of fetishization, which in the 
                            Marxist sense is the quantification of the qualitative that allows for abstraction to take over. The 
                            fetishized commodity supplies its own ideology in the market, and allows for augmentations of its 
                            exchange value without revealing the socioenvironmental circumstances of its production.

                        <p>
                            Commodity fetishism in the modern era merged economics, politics, and culture to materially 
                            enact an ideology of progress, resulting in behemoth infrastructures which served as monuments
                            to engineering and technological progress. In the span of a decade from 1904-1914, the 
                            construction of the Panama Canal resulted in the excavation of more than 130 million cubic meters 
                            of earth. The Great Depression gave birth to the Hoover Dam, impounding Lake Mead for 
                            hydroelectric power and containing more than 3.3 million cubic meters of concrete. These 
                            megastructures operated at a scale unfathomable to the human body, iconic in both size and impact. 
                            With the abandonment of this techno-optimist ideology following the abysmal living conditions 
                            characteristic of post-industrial cities and the mechanical destruction of the two world wars, 
                            came the erasure of urban networks from visible, physical space; a transition from the monumental 
                            to the mundane. Contemporary urban infrastructures are invisible: pipes, cables, electronic waves 
                            that sever the connection between the social transformation of nature and the process of 
                            urbanization. In this sense, physical infrastructures are the residue, the material byproducts of 
                            the process of capitalism, viewed only as instruments in the service of additional value
                            extraction, and can be extended to include the material city itself - and embedded in this 
                            material manifestation are power dynamics which facilitate the flow of capital, often in service 
                            of those with purchasing wealth. In our globalized economy, these flows transcend geographic and 
                            political boundaries, directionally fixed from sites of extraction to territories of mass consumption.

                        <p id="body_title_minor">1.05<span class="tab">Infrastructure in motion</p>
                        <p>
                            Here we stumble upon a fundamental paradox of capital as it relates to infrastructure: how does one 
                            reconcile the dynamism of capital in perpetual motion and fluctuation with infrastructur that is 
                            static and immobile in space? One could argue that this tension manifests as the creative destruction 
                            of the built environment and ceaseless restructuring of scale economies, characteristic of the 
                            cityscape in advanced capitalism. Instability, in the urban context, thus occurs when a paradigm shift 
                            in capital flow commands a radical restructuring of the physical infrastructures that must adjust to 
                            enable its realization. From this several questions arise: how does the erratic flow of capital affect 
                            the colonization of nature? How can one intervene in the static, built environment to influence these 
                            flows, either to stabilize or stimulate its corresponding capitalist system? How will infrastructure’s 
                            legacy manifest itself both materially and aesthetically upon future cityscapes?<br><br>

                            Identifying infrastructures as being primary, secondary, or tertiary respective to its corresponding 
                            role in extraction, commodification, and information distribution, then commodification with the 
                            emergence of late capitalism shows tertiary infrastructures with ever increasing scale and scope, 
                            inversely related to their presence in physical space. The long timescales and inertia of built 
                            infrastructure, when contrasted with the immediacy and rapid evolution of digital information and 
                            boom/bust cycles poses significant point of investigation for this project. In looking at the 
                            post-industrial evolution of currency from the gold standard to the digital, we can perhaps draw some 
                            conclusions about how modern societies can develop resiliency in the face of rapid capital flows as we 
                            mature through the age of information.

                        <p id="body_title_minor">1.06<span class="tab">The Gold Standard</p>
                        <p>
                            Arguably the most classically transformative paradigm shift in the history of currency, the 
                            establishment of a formal gold standard among the major trading nations during the 19th century reveal 
                            the scale and scope to which capital flows can reshape the urban and its subsidiary landscape. Gold has 
                            existed as a form of currency since as early as 610BC, but it wasn’t until the era of colonization and 
                            rapidly expanding global markets that the  metal became incongruously cumbersome to transport across 
                            vast distances. Where before the value of the gold coin was embedded in the material of the coin 
                            itself, the introduction of the gold standard allowed for a more efficient representation of value - in 
                            this case, paper currency - that was still fixed upon some definite quantity of gold.<br><br>

                            This new mode of representation not only facilitated the global trade by establishing trust between 
                            governments which could redeem any amount of paper money for its value in gold, but it also kickstarted 
                            a global feedback loop between gold mines, gold markets, and government. Burgeoning multinational trade 
                            heightened demand for gold to back the standards in the US and Europe, especially gold which could be 
                            mined as cheaply as possible to maximize the profits of colonizing nations. In turn, as their wealth 
                            grew so too did the volume of trade, propelling the demand for gold ever higher. Britain was the first 
                            to adopt a gold specie standard in 1821, followed by the United States and Germany in 1873.

                        <p id="body_title_minor">1.07<span class="tab">Critical instabilities</p>
                        <p>
                            This system, however, proved unstable as each injection of new gold into these economies also meant a 
                            drop in the value of gold and their corresponding currencies. Instability reached critical thresholds 
                            with the advent of the first world war, when the standard was suspended to enable bulk printing of 
                            paper currency to fund military involvement - instigating a period of hyperinflation as the value of 
                            currency was no longer stabilized to a regulated material form. The standard failed once again during 
                            the Great Depression, as investors began trading in currencies which subsequently raised the value of 
                            gold and promoted widespread hoarding during the fallout of trust in American banking institutions 
                            following the stock market crash. An equally powerful counterswing instigated by Roosevelt, in an 
                            attempt to stymy depletion, then resulted in the largest global consolidation of gold stock in the 
                            Federal Reserve. Because of this majority share, the US dollar had become the de facto world currency 
                            by the 1944 Bretton Woods Agreement, which fixed all exchange values in terms of gold.<br><br>

                            This marked the beginning of a new dynamic in gold’s role as a commodity: where before its use value 
                            lay in the ease with which it could be liquidated (exchanged for cash), this function has now been 
                            replaced by cash itself. Instead of stockpiling gold, other countries began stockpiling the US dollar, 
                            thus turning a paper currency into a commodity, where its value is not fixed to some quantifiable 
                            material but rather to the scale and scope in which it is used. Though the gold standard officially 
                            ended on August 15, 1971 when the ballooning value of the US dollar due to its role as the linchpin 
                            of the world economy could no longer be backed by its gold reserves, and the Fed could no longer 
                            redeem dollars with gold, the metal continues to embody an asset of real value in the global social 
                            conscience, as exemplified in its purchase during periods of recession and inflation.

                            The ramifications of a globalized gold market as geopolitical infrastructure at the source of extraction 
                            and production are profound. A fascinating dive into the gold supply chain during the first four decades 
                            of the 20th century pinpoint the Transvaal region of South Africa as the supplier of 35% of the world’s 
                            gold production, and the approximately 50,000 tons of gold extracted since the end of the 19th century 
                            account for almost half of all gold ever mined through the course of human history. The transformations 
                            in this area, in particular the rapid conversion of a primarily agrarian society into the largest and 
                            richest metropolis of South Africa and the violence exacted upon its land and people, are inextricably 
                            tied to the politics behind the establishment and subsequent turbulences of the gold standard.

                        <p id="body_title_minor">2.01<span class="tab">As Above, So Below</p>
                        <p>
                            In the summer of 1886, prospectors struck gold on a small farm called Langlaate. This was the 
                            Witwatersrand Reef, which extends east-west for 400 kilometers and runs for some 5,000 meters below 
                            ground. Soon prospectors and migrant workers came and set up small mining camps wherever gold was 
                            struck, and Langlaate merged with clusters of other camps to form what is now the city of Johannesburg. 
                            Growth was explosive: in the year following discovery, the Reef in its entirety was estimated to 
                            contain some 7,000 people, less than half of which lived in Johannesburg itself. Not four years later, 
                            Johannesburg’s population had multiplied ten-fold, and by 1891 approximately 102,000 people resided in 
                            the city. The circumstances of Johannesburg’s formation, and the exponential growth that followed, is 
                            written permanently into the urban fabric. Previous gold discoveries in the Transvaal were all alluvial 
                            and thus transient in nature, and so the original subdivision of land in Johannesburg’s first camp 
                            clusters were closely spaced, typical of 19th century mine camp planning. By the time it became known 
                            that the Reef ran both deep and wide, the burgeoning class of migrant workers had already drawn lawyers, 
                            shopkeepers, and traders that converted the camps into more permanent buildings, crystallizing the 
                            original partition scheme into what is now Johannesburg’s central business district.<br><br>
                            
                            Transportation and other infrastructures materialized quickly within this period, with piped water, 
                            electricity, and telephones appearing in the first two years, and South Africa’s first railway system 
                            inaugurated by the beginning of 1890. Initially servicing the predominant east-west run of the Reef, 
                            these infrastructures soon had to negotiate the mining waste dumps, sometimes deposited just meters 
                            away from the mine entrances due to the initial ad hoc zoning restrictions, that resulted from a shift 
                            into deep-level mining after surface outcrops ran low. The problem of waste was further exacerbated by 
                            the low grade ore that characterized much of the Witwatersrand Reef, with some companies producing up to 
                            200,000 times as much waste as gold: an issue that only worsened as time progressed and deeper 
                            excavations were made to reach new deposits.

                        <p>
                            Today, south African mining companies remove up to 7,500 tons of earth to produce one standard gold 
                            bar’s worth of product. Put into perspective, given that Johannesburg roughly produced a hypothetical 
                            40% of the gold in the US reserve at its peak, the equivalent waste mound would cover the entire 
                            footprint of Central Park with the height of One World Trade Center, four times over. As railway and 
                            automobile infrastructures continued to mature over the next few decades, connecting the sites of gold 
                            extraction with the major ports of South Africa for export, the tight weave of transit networks and 
                            waste formed a permanent and prominent belt along the east-west axis of the city and its subjugate 
                            landscape, splitting it into two distinct, unequal halves.<br><br>
                            
                            The material residue of gold mining in Johannesburg in turn shaped the geospatial division of 
                            socio-economic class, as delineated through the restructuring of power during the Second Boer War in 
                            1899 and the apartheid era politics that followed. At the crux of these political upheavals was a 
                            fundamental economic problem: how to make the low grade ore profitable? Deep-level mining required 
                            advanced knowledge and expensive machinery, which shifted the landscape of extraction from small-scale 
                            manual panning by opportunists at the onset to large-scale mining operations often owned by wealthy 
                            corporations abroad. As the extent of Witwatersrand Reef became clear, so too did political tensions 
                            over who would gain control of the lucrative resource, especially with the adoption of the gold 
                            standard. Established by the Boers after Great Britain annexed their Cape Colony during the Napoleonic 
                            Wars, the Transvaal and Orange Free State initially drew many foreigners to its borders with the 
                            discovery of diamonds at Kimberley in 1866. Soon after the discovery of gold in 1886, the Boers 
                            understood that they lacked both the manpower and the industrial expertise to develop the resource, 
                            and so reluctantly allowed the immigration of foreigners, called uitlanders, to the Transvaal. Many of 
                            these immigrants were English-speaking men from Britain, and soon their population challenged and 
                            potentially exceeded that of the original Boer settlers, which precipitated tensions between the two 
                            groups. In part driven by expansionist ideology, a notable proponent of which was mining magnate and 
                            early gold investor Cecil Rhodes, as well as attempts to obtain full voting rights for the uitlanders, 
                            the British attempted to raid the city in 1895 and finally gained control of the Transvaal and its 
                            allied Orange Free State in 1902.

                        <p>
                            With political ownership of Johannesburg’s gold established, it became clear that a profitable 
                            enterprise would not have been possible without an abundance of cheap, unskilled labor from
                            disenfranchised migrant workers. The gold standard meant that pricing was internationally controlled, 
                            and so any increases in operational costs could not be passed down to consumers through price 
                            increases. The United States and other major European powers were major gold importers, and it was 
                            also in their best interests to keep the price of gold low; thus, maintaining a constant supply of 
                            cheap labor became a primary focus for both the Boer and British governments as well as the mine
                            owners. The following decades oversaw the political, social, and economic control of a huge 
                            population of black Africans for this singular purpose. Through governmental and white acquisition of 
                            land, harsh property taxes, and militaristic destabilization of neighboring African nations, the 
                            development of the mining industry destroyed independent farming as a way of life and completely 
                            reconfigured the socioeconomic structures of South Africa. A host of governmental policies spanning 
                            the first four decades of the 20th century, ranging from the criminalization of job desertion and the 
                            issuance of black passes to municipal segregation and the prohibition of blacks from buying or renting
                            land outside of designated zones, were put in place to prevent upward mobility and to promote 
                            unemployment among the native African communities.<br><br>
                            
                            These policies also, by necessity due to the growing ratio of poor black laborers to white owners and 
                            officials that by 1913 already more than doubled, created a distinct spatial separation of the groups 
                            by discouraging interracial interaction outside of the mines themselves - a spatial pattern strongly 
                            reinforced during the Apartheid era that followed. By the 1930’s, various black-only townships were 
                            established on cheap land as a result of forced reallocation. Until that point, the lack of adequate 
                            housing for Johannesburg’s vast working class resulted primarily in underserved, mixed-race 
                            shantytowns near the city center that have been earmarked for removal. The Great Depression then
                            sparked a period of brief economic expansion, when the price of gold shot up due to the increase of 
                            global demand with the abandonment of the gold standard, providing the South African government with 
                            the funds necessary to separate and reallocate entire populations of black laborers. The largest 
                            resettlement became what is today the township of Soweto, located just south of the central business 
                            district, downwind from the massive mine dumps that divided the city. Here, land was cheap due to the 
                            lack of transportation infrastructure, and as a result of the environmental hazards of living near 
                            toxic waste dumps.<br><br>
                            
                            The next decades of Apartheid reinforced this pattern of isolating the wealthy, predominantly white 
                            community into well serviced and well developed urban areas upwind of the waste belt, and relegating 
                            the poor, black working class to sprawling shantytowns south - sometimes on top of the mounds 
                            themselves. And just as racial segregation was territorialized within the urban and periurban areas, 
                            the separation between urban and rural also became incredibly pronounced: stripping agricultural land
                            of its male workers and leaving their families to be supported by low mine wages in effect created a 
                            dynamic where mine profits are maximized by policies that caused long term rural underdevelopment and 
                            poverty still in existence today.

                            South Africa’s economy, created from and dependent upon its gold mines, is now suffering from exhausted 
                            deposits, increasingly expensive excavations, and extreme groundwater and air pollution from the 
                            resulting waste. The large mining monopolies of the 20th century have dissolved into smaller South 
                            African enterprises that, with new and more advanced refinement technology, have begun to re-mine the 
                            waste dumps which contain small particulate gold unsuccessfully harvested in the century prior. Where 
                            the original commodification process left distinct spatial geographies as delineated by these waste 
                            dumps, their removal will instigate new dynamics within the urban and periurban fabric. Without process 
                            regulation, all of the generated wealth will continue to flow into global markets while the original 
                            mounds will be processed outside of the city and dumped in the periurban territory south of the low 
                            income communities. Due to the waste belt’s proximity to the central business district, and with the 
                            removal of waste leading to more favorable living conditions, the real estate value of the land will 
                            rapidly increase and the nearby communities will gentrify. This land will most likely be developed into 
                            higher income housing, and with the absence of biohazard waste to keep landvalue low, new urban lines 
                            will be drawn as the previous poor communities who lived on and around the mounds will eventually 
                            relocate even further outside the city to south of the new waste mounds.<br><br>
                            
                            Here is an opportunity for policy regulation and the built environment to respond to such a large 
                            scale re-extraction of natural resources: by fixing the waste in place and rehabilitating it, this 
                            power dynamic would be stabilized to create value for the poor communities while providing a buffer 
                            for the rich, thus generating a more even distribution of wealth between the two communities while 
                            maintaining urban densities. Thus the lesson from Johannesburg is through the material regulation of
                            extractive processes to fix them in place, which would reduce the turbulence of the existing 
                            socioeconomic geography. By keeping the waste dumps where they are, but allowing for in situ
                            infrastructural construction within them, the waste belt would be less of a wall and more of a 
                            mediator between the existing communities. The original infrastructural problem was a direct result 
                            of Johannesburg’s rapid materialization, at enormous scales due to global demand for gold. To avoid 
                            this mistake again, one must phase the remining process and allow it to happen heterogeneously 
                            through space and time.

                            The instability of the gold standard is at its core based on the nature of commodification, where the 
                            separation of use value and exchange value enables a flip flopping between their relative strengths. 
                            The emergence of a gold standard thus coincided with the carving of new geographies of power, and each 
                            subsequent turbulence in value reverberated down its infrastructural pipelines to its territories of 
                            extraction and production. To effect change and to build resiliency into existing infrastructures, one 
                            must regulate the process by which material extraction proceeds into capital.<br><br>
                            
                            What can we learn from the infrastructural instabilities in Johannesburg as a result of the capital 
                            flow during the gold standard? In order to prevent the ad hoc rapid remining and large-scale 
                            redevelopment processes from destabilizing the socioeconomic structure of the city, one potential 
                            solution is to allow for the phasing of remining to occur concurrently with development at various 
                            stages over time, while also regulating the process to happen heterogenously in space. The era of
                            centralized infrastructure is coming to an end; material stability must begin to rely on the 
                            redundancies of distributed systems to survive our faster future.

                            “Isaura, city of the thousand wells, is said to rise over a deep, subterranean lake. On all sides, 
                            wherever the inhabitants dig long vertical holes in the ground, they succeed in drawing up water, 
                            as far as the city extends, and no farther. Its green border repeats the dark outline of the buried 
                            lake; an invisible landscape conditions the visible one; everything that moves in the sunlight is 
                            driven by the lapping wave enclosed beneath the rock’s calcareous sky.”

                            As systems-based thinking gradually reforms the domain of technical knowledge in the 21st century, 
                            architects largely continue to abstract the building as an object unto itself: distinct from and not 
                            beholden to the processes, materials, people, and consumptive forces with which every built structure 
                            is in dialogue. This erasure of material memory leads to an accumulation of infrastructural residue 
                            as old systems pass into obsolescence and extractive violence upon the landscape begins anew, leaving
                            behind an unintentional city and blind inhabitants.<br><br>
                            
                            Birthed upon gold reefs, their mined detritus monumental within the urban fabric, Johannesburg is 
                            perfectly situated to negotiate processes of extraction with those of construction as these artificial 
                            mountains are now being hydrologically excavated for redevelopment. This project is a functional 
                            choreography of the regimens found in everyday life with the infrastructure of resource production - 
                            of water and gold - upon which these rituals are built, in an attempt to materialize through 
                            architectural agency the conditions of extraction that are typically unseen.

                            “Tip the world on its side, and everything loose will land in Los Angeles.”
                            <br>- Frank Lloyd Wright
                        </p>
                    
                        <p>
                            The narrative of 20th century Los Angeles begins with the formulation of a human ecology. As first 
                            generation immigrant colonies gestated within major metropolitan areas in the United States, 
                            sociologists predicted a race relation lifecycle of contact, competition, conflict, and ultimately 
                            a spatial assimilation as American suburbia slowly absorbed these foreign bodies. The stage was set 
                            for instability. Underneath the negotiations of territory and belonging in the decades that followed 
                            lay a theater of cultural identity and cultural (re)production, enacted by displaced individuals and 
                            communities asking the same, persistent question: ‘we are not from here - so who are we?’.<br><br>
                            
                            These moments of identity crisis and identity formation are captured in the small dramas of 
                            neighborhoods forced to become something culturally other. Take Olvera Street in downtown LA, 1930: 
                            home to a century-old Mexican community, poor, disadvantaged, rundown, and the perfect crucible for 
                            southern socialite Christine Sterling to test the commercial and touristic potency of a recently 
                            imported, romanticized Spanish Colonial Revival style. In a singular move that Ada Louise Huxtable 
                            would later describe as ‘the glorification of the unreal over the real’, a curiously American 
                            phenomenon driven by consumer obsession with iconic re-creations that appear more real than the 
                            original, Olvera rematerialized overnight not as authentically Mexican, but rather as a sort of 
                            Mexican kitsch, a shallow copy of terracotta tiles and stucco arches now considered to be Californian 
                            vernacular.<br><br>
                            
                            Cue Frederic Hsieh, a young and hotheaded Taiwanese American realtor dismissed by a distinctively 
                            affluent housing board for “coming into their living room and changing the furniture”, in his bid to 
                            convert the sparsely populated but predominantly white Monterey Park into a Chinese Beverly Hills. 
                            Hsieh dreamed of both resort and refuge for the Chinese during the 1970s, a time when East Asia was 
                            disintegrating, immigration quotas were expanding, and globalized trade took center stage on the 
                            national political agenda. Monterey Park and the neighboring San Gabriel Valley have since rapidly 
                            transformed into a constellation of decentralized ethnoburbs, immigrant growth machines that are 
                            spatially entangled and yet operationally liberated from their old suburban hosts. Within this 
                            recolonization resides a consumptive inheritance of Spanish Colonial structures erected by wealthy 
                            white Protestants, now garnished and ornamented with sometimes exclusively mandarin signage.<br><br>
                            
                            Los Angeles has never professed a singular spatial syntax, nor a coherent architectural grammar; it is 
                            a city assimilating in perpetuity, of make-believe homes owned by imposter inhabitants. Local 
                            structures, infrastructures, and superstructures are constantly redefined during acts of identity 
                            protest: the provisional non-Japanese repopulation of a vacant Little Tokyo during internment following 
                            the attack on Pearl Harbor in the 1940s; the blockbusting origins of black Compton born from 
                            fear-driven white flight in the 1960s, at a time where 90% of Los Angeles was legally restricted from 
                            African American residency; the violence of Rodney King riots rendering visible the informal boundaries 
                            of a vigilante Koreatown in the 1990s, self-patrolled with semi-automatics along storefronts and 
                            rooftops that made explicit the racial lines of a vandalized minority community. These iridescent 
                            upheavals leave behind houses, shopping centers, roads, town halls and churches like a shed husk, 
                            awkwardly fit to their incoming residents - fertile grounds for the invention of a new language of the 
                            commons, a migrant Order in a palimpsestic, self-masticating city where entire neighborhoods are 
                            digested, rewritten, and reborn in situ.<br><br>
                            
                            Palladio was no foreigner to socio-economic conflict. In sixteenth century Venice, food shortages and 
                            famine spurred by the Ottoman Empire’s seizure of former Venetian colonies prompted the city’s merchant 
                            elite to consolidate what was formerly communal agrarian territory in the neighboring Veneto and Verona. 
                            Tensions between the wealthy landowners and the disenfranchised peasants, who worked their now privately 
                            owned lands, were confined within the authoritative, hierarchical, and distinctly Italian language of 
                            the classically-trained architect; social instability was masked by idealized form, mathematically 
                            proportioned and symmetrically aligned. Thus the Palladian Villa is always, at its contextual and 
                            functional core, a negotiation between domesticity, public cultural identity, and agricultural 
                            production. The archetypical villa masses the private residential quarters at the focal point, insulated 
                            from the convulsing landscape by an exterior ring of subsidiary programs such as barns, stables, and 
                            service quarters  - a spatial arrangement which suggests both dominion of and defense against a 
                            rapidly-changing geopolitics, by those who profited from instability. In the absence of grand civic 
                            buildings, Palladio’s villa serves as a domestic collective space for the gentrifying rural Veneto, a 
                            cross-section of servants, patricians, and their various guests, tied to their context by their origin 
                            as working farms.<br><br>
                            
                            Much like the fragmented territories of the Venetian colonies before Palladio, the disparate ethnoburbs 
                            of Los Angeles lack a symbolic and visual language of a Commons around which these volatile communities 
                            can articulate their cultural but situationally a-historic identities. However, rather than adopt a 
                            centralized, fortified, and rigid disposition, the suburban civic space must by necessity interface 
                            with its fluid residents and embrace its multiethnic heritage.<br><br>
                            
                            In this manner, the Veronese outlier Villa Serego is singular among the proposals of the Quattro Libri: 
                            instead of a domineering primary residential volume distended by smaller secondary and tertiary 
                            structures, the Serego instead captures, at its core, a void. Contained within is a courtyard, echoing 
                            the communal atria of ancient Roman dwellings, and a double portico as a vestibule to both the 
                            surrounding private quarters and a public-facing peristylium. This external courtyard is sliced open, 
                            flanked by two agricultural spaces, and idiosyncratically articulated by a heavily-rusticated Ionic 
                            colonnade which references the stylistic qualities of earlier Veronese buildings. Here the colonnade is 
                            our primary actor: it is the organizational interface between public and private, always present and 
                            negotiating between an intimate collective, the domicile, industry, and the open landscape. The 
                            mercurial quality of Villa Serego is further illustrated by its built history and bastardization of 
                            Palladio’s original design, spanning four centuries of broken construction - it is a synthetic 
                            narrative of partial ownerships and grafted styles, functioning intermittently as residence, farm, and 
                            winery, and persistently, through its open courtyards and colonnades, as a semi-public commons.<br><br>
                            
                            Andrea Palladio would model the inverted organization of Villa Serego for an ethnically regurgitating 
                            Angelino suburbia, using cultural ornament and the colonnade as a mediator between old and new. The 
                            productive commons now engages an ever-changing residential context through the additive layering of a 
                            migrant aesthetic upon existing architectural styles. He would graft the pastoral, bucolic Arkadía of 
                            Venice onto the modern day, bulimic Arcadia of the San Gabriel Valley. In the now predominantly Chinese 
                            and Latino ethnoburbs of East Los Angeles, the commons are no longer the traditional spaces of public 
                            authority - churches, government buildings, transit hubs and parks, but rather shift into the most 
                            productive bastion of cultural identity: commerce and cuisine. The unobtrusive yet quintessential corner 
                            shopping plaza, with family-owned restaurants and grocery stores sitting piecemeal like recalcitrant 
                            line cooks in a parking lot, within which residents both rich and poor from neighboring streets, 
                            neighboring towns, from across a hard, brutal Los Angeles, congregate underneath shaded overhangs until 
                            the moment of gathering, taking seat around home-style dishes from some foreign, yet uncannily familiar, 
                            land.<br><br>
                            
                            The asphalt courtyard, dotted with cars and crossed with columns, becomes the suburban place of public 
                            congregation. Distended porticos, dressed in Chinatown generic, mirror the haphazard partitioning of 
                            similarly ersatz colonial buildings - still clad with stucco arches and spanish tile - by their new 
                            inhabitants. The hand-me-down spaces, often poorly tailored, find structure from the negotiated grid, 
                            locally oriented and aligned to the urban fabric.Double colonnades expose the dual nature of 
                            consumption: a caustic city on one side and quiet residence on the other, while providing the pedestrian 
                            civic space that suburban communities desperately need. These roadside shopping plazas, restructured 
                            with public porticos, are ripe for a new, migrant order; they are humble portals between domicile and 
                            globalized commerce, garnishing the intersections of major throughways and local main streets, and 
                            stabilizing sites of conflict with the architectural ethos and prosthetic vernacular of an itinerant 
                            Los Angeles.
