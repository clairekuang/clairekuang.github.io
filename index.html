                            Projects have no end. They become methodologies from the moment of their inception, little potentials of energy with the capacity to *do work*, path-dependant vectors of intent and implementation.
                            This compedium is a highlight reel of projects that bring together context, research, form, and effect as a synthetic narrative - drawing tools and technologies as needed, 
                            irreverent to discipline, exuberantly wip.

                        <p>
                            To situate the terms ‘capital’, ‘commodity’, and ‘infrastructure’
                            within a Marxist framework, capital is defined as the accumulation
                            of wealth specifically through the process of circulation - a
                            dynamic driven by the difference between a commodity’s use
                            value and its exchange value. The capitalist then understands
                            this value as being in constant motion, where profit is generated
                            through perpetual reinvestment and consequent augmentation
                            of exchange value. The nature of this value-added exchange is
                            then contextualized through how one chooses to define the term
                            ‘commodity’; and indeed, the chasm between commodity as it
                            first appears in Das Kapital and as it is currently understood in the
                            global markets is quite extensive. To Marx, commodity was “an
                            object outside us, a thing that by its properties satisfies human
                            wants of some sort or another”, and where “the nature of such
                            wants, whether, for instance, they spring from the stomach or
                            from fancy, makes no difference...neither are we here concerned
                            to know how the object satisfies these wants, whether directly
                            as means of subsistence, or indirectly as means of production”.
                            This definition is metaphysical in disposition, and is concerned
                            less with the tangible qualifications by which a specific
                            externality is commodified than it is with the understanding that
                            commodification is a process implicitly tied to human desire. As
                            such, desire being a fickle beast, the commodity is monadic as
                            a unit endowed with perceptual virtue, and it is this appended
                            quality that gains in value through transformations of exchange
                            by social and political forces.

                        <p id="body_title">Consumptive futures</p>
                        <p>
                            Contemporary economics, however, defines the commodities
                            trade far more tangibly: such objects are typically uniform in
                            pricing across many markets, are used in the production of other
                            goods, and can be extracted or grown and traded in sufficiently
                            high quantities. These traits allow them to support extremely
                            liquid markets in which futures and options are often sold to
                            protect both producers and consumers against fluctuations in
                            price. In this context, the commodity necessarily exists on a
                            global scale, and its value in trade is defined not by a consistent
                            growth in exchange value but rather by the ease with which they
                            can be converted into money through their use in other, more
                            refined products. Thus cocoa, copper, wheat, oil, and coal qualify
                            whereas diamonds, due to their inconsistencies in quality, and
                            natural gas, due to its predisposition for price determination
                            through long term regional contracts, do not. The modern
                            commodity exists in material form only briefly; its primary
                            purpose is to be liquidated as quickly as possible for as much as
                            possible. The selling of futures - the functional equivalent of the
                            Marxist exchange value - is now complete in its disembodiment
                            from the physical realities of the object itself, acting as a
                            stand-in independent from the actual volume of material being
                            extracted or produced. Where the Marxist perspective portrays
                            the commodity as an object with appended metaphysical value,
                            in perpetual circulation, the economics of today suggest they
                            are transient one-way pipelines from production at scale to
                            diversified, globalized consumption.

                        <p>
                            In this discourse, the term ‘infrastructure’ exists purely in relation
                            to the flows that enable capital accumulation through the
                            production and consumption of commodities. Maria Kaika and
                            Erik Swyngedouw identify technological networks as the “material
                            mediators between nature and the city; they carry the flow and
                            process of transformation of one into the other”. The process
                            of assigning market relations to socially metabolized goods is
                            fundamentally dependent on the process of fetishization, which in
                            the Marxist sense is the quantification of the qualitative that allows
                            for abstraction to take over. The fetishized commodity supplies
                            its own ideology in the market, and allows for augmentations
                            of its exchange value without revealing the socioenvironmental
                            circumstances of its production.

                        <p>
                            Commodity fetishism in the modern era merged economics,
                            politics, and culture to materially enact an ideology of progress,
                            resulting in behemoth infrastructures which served as monuments
                            to engineering and technological progress. In the span of a decade
                            from 1904-1914, the construction of the Panama Canal resulted
                            in the excavation of more than 130 million cubic meters of earth.
                            The Great Depression gave birth to the Hoover Dam, impounding
                            Lake Mead for hydroelectric power and containing more than 3.3
                            million cubic meters of concrete. These megastructures operated
                            at a scale unfathomable to the human body, iconic in both size
                            and impact. With the abandonment of this techno-optimist
                            ideology following the abysmal living conditions characteristic
                            of post-industrial cities and the mechanical destruction of the
                            two world wars, came the erasure of urban networks from
                            visible, physical space; a transition from the monumental to the
                            mundane. Contemporary urban infrastructures are invisible:
                            pipes, cables, electronic waves that sever the connection
                            between the social transformation of nature and the process
                            of urbanization. In this sense, physical infrastructures are the
                            residue, the material byproducts of the process of capitalism,
                            viewed only as instruments in the service of additional value
                            extraction, and can be extended to include the material city
                            itself - and embedded in this material manifestation are power
                            dynamics which facilitate the flow of capital, often in service of
                            those with purchasing wealth. In our globalized economy, these
                            flows transcend geographic and political boundaries, directionally
                            fixed from sites of extraction to territories of mass consumption.

                        <p id="body_title">Infrastructure in motion</p>
                        <p>
                            Here we stumble upon a fundamental paradox of capital as it
                            relates to infrastructure: how does one reconcile the dynamism
                            of capital in perpetual motion and fluctuation with infrastructure
                            that is static and immobile in space? One could argue that
                            this tension manifests as the creative destruction of the built
                            environment and ceaseless restructuring of scale economies,
                            characteristic of the cityscape in advanced capitalism. Instability,
                            in the urban context, thus occurs when a paradigm shift in
                            capital flow commands a radical restructuring of the physical
                            infrastructures that must adjust to enable its realization. From
                            this several questions arise: how does the erratic flow of capital
                            affect the colonization of nature? How can one intervene in
                            the static, built environment to influence these flows, either to
                            stabilize or stimulate its corresponding capitalist system? How
                            will infrastructure’s legacy manifest itself both materially and
                            aesthetically upon future cityscapes?

                            Identifying infrastructures as being primary, secondary, or tertiary
                            respective to its corresponding role in extraction, commodification,
                            and information distribution, then commodification with the
                            emergence of late capitalism shows tertiary infrastructures
                            with ever increasing scale and scope, inversely related to their
                            presence in physical space. The long timescales and inertia of
                            built infrastructure, when contrasted with the immediacy and
                            rapid evolution of digital information and boom/bust cycles poses
                            significant point of investigation for this project. In looking at the
                            post-industrial evolution of currency from the gold standard to
                            the digital, we can perhaps draw some conclusions about how
                            modern societies can develop resiliency in the face of rapid
                            capital flows as we mature through the age of information.

                        <p id="body_title">The Gold Standard</p>
                        <p>
                            Arguably the most classically transformative paradigm shift in the
                            history of currency, the establishment of a formal gold standard
                            among the major trading nations during the 19th century reveal
                            the scale and scope to which capital flows can reshape the
                            urban and its subsidiary landscape. Gold has existed as a form
                            of currency since as early as 610BC, but it wasn’t until the era
                            of colonization and rapidly expanding global markets that the
                            metal became incongruously cumbersome to transport across
                            vast distances. Where before the value of the gold coin was
                            embedded in the material of the coin itself, the introduction of
                            the gold standard allowed for a more efficient representation
                            of value- in this case, paper currency - that was still fixed upon
                            some definite quantity of gold.

                            This new mode of representation not only facilitated the global
                            trade by establishing trust between governments which could
                            redeem any amount of paper money for its value in gold, but
                            it also kickstarted a global feedback loop between gold mines,
                            gold markets, and government. Burgeoning multinational trade
                            heightened demand for gold to back the standards in the US
                            and Europe, especially gold which could be mined as cheaply
                            as possible to maximize the profits of colonizing nations. In turn,
                            as their wealth grew so too did the volume of trade, propelling
                            the demand for gold ever higher. Britain was the first to adopt a
                            gold specie standard in 1821, followed by the Unites States and
                            Germany in 1873.

                        <p id="body_title">Critical instabilities</p>
                        <p>
                            This system, however, proved unstable as each injection of
                            new gold into these economies also meant a drop in the value
                            of gold and their corresponding currencies. Instability reached
                            critical thresholds with the advent of the first world war, when
                            the standard was suspended to enable bulk printing of paper
                            currency to fund military involvement - instigating a period of
                            hyperinflation as the value of currency was no longer stabilized to
                            a regulated material form. The standard failed once again during
                            the Great Depression, as investors began trading in currencies
                            which subsequently raised the value of gold and promoted
                            widespread hoarding during the fallout of trust in American
                            banking institutions following the stock market crash. An equally
                            powerful counterswing instigated by Roosevelt, in an attempt to
                            stymy depletion, then resulted in the largest global consolidation
                            of gold stock in the Federal Reserve. Because of this majority
                            share, the US dollar had become the de facto world currency by
                            the 1944 Bretton Woods Agreement, which fixed all exchange
                            values in terms of gold.

                            This marked the beginning of a new dynamic in gold’s role as a
                            commodity: where before its use value lay in the ease with which
                            it could be liquidated (exchanged for cash), this function has now
                            been replaced by cash itself. Instead of stockpiling gold, other
                            countries began stockpiling the US dollar, thus turning a paper
                            currency into a commodity, where its value is not fixed to some
                            quantifiable material but rather to the scale and scope in which it
                            is used. Though the gold standard officially ended on August 15,
                            1971 when the ballooning value of the US dollar due to its role
                            as the linchpin of the world economy could no longer be backed
                            by its gold reserves, and the Fed could no longer redeem dollars
                            with gold, the metal continues to embody an asset of real value
                            in the global social conscience, as exemplified in its purchase
                            during periods of recession and inflation.
